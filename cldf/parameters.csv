1-mother,mother,,,1-mother,"  A vernacular prefix added to kinship terms, personal names and personal pronouns, e.g. Mand. ā-mǔ 阿母 ‘mother’ [Han texts], ā-nú  阿奴 ‘younger brother’, ā-shuí  阿誰 ‘who’, ā-nǐ 阿你 ‘you’ (Norman 1988: 113); Yuè-Guǎngzhōu a³³-ma⁵⁵ (Ɂaᶜ¹-maᴬ¹) 阿媽 ‘mother, mama’, a³³-ma²¹ (Ɂaᶜ¹-maᴬ²) 阿雙 ‘grandmother’.  ||  [E] ST: PTB *Ɂa- is a prefix for kinship terms, body parts or nouns in general, depending on the language (STC: 121-123), e.g. WB ə-tʰaŋ ‘thought’ < tʰaŋ ‘think’, ə-pʰuiᴮ ‘grandfather’; WT Ɂa-kʰu ‘uncle, husband’. "
2-tiger,tiger,,,2-tiger,"  Occurs already in Zuǒzhuàn prefixed to the Chǔ dialect word for → hǔ1 虎 ‘tiger’. Unger (Hao-ku 33, 1986) suggests that certain words with MC initial Ɂ-  might be the result of a fusion of this prefix with the following stem (§5.11).   "
3-Youngerbrother,Younger brother,,,3-Youngerbrother,"  ‘Younger brother’ [Jìn Dyn.] (Norman 1988: 113).  ||  [E] For phonological and semantic reasons, this word is prob. not related to rú 孺 *no ‘child’ (under → rú4 懦臑 ‘weak’), nor to → rǔ3 乳 ‘milk’. It may be connec ted to PTB *naːw (STC no. 271): Lushai nauᴴ < nau ‘child, younger brother or sister, younger cousin’ etc., JP kə³¹-nau³³ ‘younger brother / sister’, WT nu-bo ‘man’s younger brother’. The putative OC final *ā cannot be reconciled with PTB *āːw, though; perh. the CH word has been re-etymologized, or only committed to writing after *a > MC o. "
4-Topity,To pity,,,4-Topity,  ‘To pity’ [Shi] is prob. a sound-symbolic word. 
7-Whitehairedold,"White-haired, old",,,7-Whitehairedold,"  ‘White-haired, old’ [Shi], possibly related to TB items under → yuè1 月 ‘moon’, but the vowels do not agree.  ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR ŋaj (去); MGZY ŋay (去) [ŋaj] "
8-Tolovetogrudge,"To love, to grudge",,,8-Tolovetogrudge,"  ‘To love, to grudge’ [Shi] > Mand. ‘to like, be fond of’.   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu  SR Ɂaj (去); MGZY ’ay (去) [Ɂaj]; ONW Ɂɑiᶜ   ||  [E] ST: TB-PKaren *ʔai (Matisoff BSOAS 63.3, 2000: 364). Or MK *sʔəəc, *sʔaac ‘to love, pity’ (Shorto 2006 #798a)."
9-Toloseone,To lose one,,,9-Toloseone,  ‘To lose one’s breath’ [Shi] is a sound-symbolic word (§2.9)  
11-Obstructhinder,"Obstruct, hinder",,,11-Obstructhinder,"  ‘Obstruct, hinder’ [Lie].   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu  SR ŋaj (去); MGZY ngay (去) [ŋaj]; ONW ŋɑiᶜ   ||  [E] ? ST: WT ’geg(s)-pa, bkag, dgag ‘to hinder, prohibit, shut’ ᛝ ’gag ‘obstruction, stoppage’ (Bodman 1980: 72); PLB *Ɂgak ‘obstruct, block up’. TB voiced stops do occasionally correspond to Chinese initial nasals (§5.12.2). Alternatively, WT could be compared with → gù1 固. CH ài may be related to → yí13 疑 ‘hesitate’. "
12-Becalmpeacefulstillsteadytakeone,"Be calm, peaceful, still, steady, take one",,,12-Becalmpeacefulstillsteadytakeone,"  ‘Be calm, peaceful, still, steady, take one’s leisure’ [BI, Shi].   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR Ɂɔn (平); PR Ɂan; LR Ɂan; MGZY ’an (平) [Ɂan]; ONW Ɂɑn. "
13-Topushdownwiththehand,To push down with the hand,,,13-Topushdownwiththehand,"  ‘To push down with the hand’ [SW], ‘to stop, repress’ [Shi], ‘lay hand on, seize’ [Xun]; ‘stool, tray’ 案 [Zhouli].  ||  [<] exoactive of ān (§4.3), lit. ‘cause to be settled, calmed’.   ||  [C] Boltz (1994: 95ff) includes additional words which are written with this phonetic (GSR 146), such as → ān3 鞍. A parallel stem (§2.5) is → yàn1 宴燕 (Wáng Lì 1982: 543). → yǎn5 偃 is prob. a different etymon. "
15-Saddle,Saddle,,,15-Saddle,"  ‘Saddle’ [Guanzi] is cognate to → ān1 安 acc. to Boltz (1994: 95f), lit. ‘seat’. Following the Shìmíng, Pulleyblank has suggested a connection with è 頞 (Ɂat) ‘bridge of the nose’ [Meng] (Boltz 1994: 98). "
16-Dumbsilent,"Dumb, silent",,,16-Dumbsilent,"  ‘Dumb, silent’ [Mo].    ||  [E] ST *Ɂum: PTB *um ‘hold in the mouth’ (STC: 181) > WT Ɂum ‘a kiss’ (cf. Ɂu ~ Ɂo ‘a kiss’); Lepcha ŭm ‘receive into the mouth without swallowing’, Mikir om ‘mouthful’, Nung im ‘mouthful’ (HST: 95). Perh. also connected with PTB *(m-)uːm (STC: 181 n. 479). → cǎn 噆 is perh. a derivation. "

18-Pentup,Pent up,,,18-Pentup,"  ‘Pent up’ [Zhuang].  ||  [<] exopass. of ān 喑 (§4.4), lit. ‘be held back in the mouth’, but the role of MC div. III is not clear (§9.1.2).  "
22-Riverbank,River bank,,,22-Riverbank,"  ‘River bank’ [Shi].   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR ŋɔn (去); PR Ɂan; LR Ɂan; MGZY ngan (去) [ŋan]; ONW ŋɑn   ||  [E] ST: WT dŋo ‘shore, bank’. "
23-Cliff,Cliff,,,23-Cliff,"  ‘Cliff’ [BI, SW], ‘high river bank’ [Liù shū běnyì 六書本義].  "
24-Riverbank,River bank,,,24-Riverbank,"  ‘River bank’ [Shi].   ||  [<] These are all nouns derived from the stem *ŋaɁ ‘oppose, resist’ (→ yù17 禦), i.e. ‘the thing that resists the river’s flow, keeps the river in its bed’. The voiceless initial in hàn and hǔ denotes a noun referring to a natural object (§5.2.4), the final *-n in hàn and àn marks nouns in general (§6.4.3). The role, if any, of tone C is not clear. For an overview of similar and related words, see under → yà2 御迓訝. "
25-Adeepblack,A deep black,,,25-Adeepblack,  ‘A deep black’ [SW].
26-Bedark,Be dark,,,26-Bedark,"  ‘Be dark’ 暗 [Guoyu]; 闇 (also read QY Ɂậmᴮ) [Li] > Mand. ‘dim, gloomy’.   ||  [T] Sin S. SR Ɂam (去); PR Ɂan; MGZY ’am (去) [Ɂam], ONW Ɂɑmᶜ.   ||  [<] perh. exoactive of àn 黯 (§4.3), here noun > verb.   ||  [C] A probable allofam is → yīn5 陰 (so Wáng Lì 1982: 602).  "
29-Asmallmouthedlargebelliedearthenjarforfetchingwater,"(A small-mouthed, large-bellied) earthen jar (for fetching water)",,,29-Asmallmouthedlargebelliedearthenjarforfetchingwater,"  ‘(A small-mouthed, large-bellied) earthen jar (for fetching water)’ [Lunheng] > ‘obese, swollen’ [Zhuang]; later 盎 ‘basin, tureen’ (which is large-mouthed).    ||  [E] MK: Khmer ’āṅa /Ɂaaŋ/ ‘a type of large, wide-mouthed earthen jar, cistern, tank’. "
31-Tocryclamor,"To cry, clamor",,,31-Tocryclamor,"  ‘To cry, clamor’ [Shi].  ||  [E] Perh. cognate to PTB *ŋuw > WT ŋu-ba ‘to weep, roar’, WB ŋui ‘cry, weep’, PL *ŋo¹ ‘cry’ (HST: 60). This identification is somewhat doubtful as the vowels and the meanings are not very close. "
32-Tofry,To fry,,,32-Tofry,"  ‘To fry’ [Zhouli], ‘roast’ [Li].  ||  [E] ST *ŋau: PTB *r-ŋaw (STC no. 270) > WT rŋod-pa, brŋos ‘to parch, roast, fry’; Chepang ŋāw; Mikir arŋu ‘roast, fry’; JP gə³¹-ŋau³³ ‘fry’ (STC: 193; also Bodman 1980: 78).  "
33-Inside,Inside,,,33-Inside,"  ‘Inside’ (of a realm) [Shi], ‘bay, cove’ was acc. to Guō Pú (ca. 300 AD) a Jiāngnán (southern) word.  ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR Ɂaw (去); MGZY ’aw (去) [Ɂaw]; ONW Ɂɑu   ||  [D] This word is still used in Mǐn dialects: Fúzhōu oᶜ¹-tʰauᴬ², Xiàmén uᶜ¹   ||  [E] MK: Viet ao ‘pool, pond’, WrMon ‘o, o ‘cove, small bay’ (Norman 1983: 205). "

36-Eight,Eight,,,36-Eight,"  ‘Eight’ [OB, Shi].   ||  [T] MTang pär, ONW pät — [D] PMin *pet, K-Méixiàn pat  ||  [E] ST *priat ~ *pret: PTB *b-r-yat (STC no. 163) > WT brgyad (< *bryat); TGTM *³pret, Kanauri *re; PLB *Ɂrit or *Ɂryat > WB hrac; Lushai paᴸ-riatF (Bodman 1980: 73); Bahing ja, Thulung jet; JP mə³¹-tsat⁵⁵ < m-rjat. CH -> Tai: PT *p-: S. pɛɛtᴰ¹ᴸ is obviously a CH loan (otherwise we should find an /r/ in the Tai initial).  "
37-Python,Python,,,37-Python,"  ‘Python’ [SW, Shanhaijing].   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR pa (平); MGZY: ba (平) [pa]); ONW pä  ||  [E] ? Kam-Tai: note Lao ŋuuᴬ⁴ kăbaaᴬ³ ‘a kind of viper: Agkistrodon’ (ŋuu ‘snake’, kă- perh. animal prefix) (James Chamberlain ICSTLL 1981). AA-PNB *qb≠àyh ‘snake’. "
38-AkindofbamboofromsouthwestChina,A kind of bamboo from southwest China,,,38-AkindofbamboofromsouthwestChina,"  ‘A kind of bamboo from southwest China’ [GY].   ||  [E] The word’s place of origin (SW China) and late appearance suggest that it is a loan from a TB language: PTB *pa [STC no. 44; Matisoff LL 1.2, 2000: 140] > WT spa ~ sba ‘cane’; WB waᴮ ‘bamboo’; JP kə⁵⁵-wa⁵⁵, wə³¹ ‘bamboo’, Lushai ruaᴴ (rɔF) (< *r-wa) ‘a kind of bamboo’ (HST: 38).  "
39-Bamboohedgeorfence,Bamboo hedge or fence,,,39-Bamboohedgeorfence,"  ‘Bamboo hedge or fence’ [GY].  ||  [E] PTB: *rpa: Kom ra-pe, Tśiru ra-pa ‘fence’ (Kuki lgs.) [Shafer: IST 29].  "
40-Scar,Scar,,,40-Scar,"  ‘Scar’ [JY].  ||  [E] ? ST: Perh. related to WT ’bar-’bar ‘uneven, rough, pock-marked’ (Unger Hao-ku  35, 1986: 36). "
41-Wildpigpig,"Wild pig, pig",,,41-Wildpigpig,"  ‘Wild pig, pig’ [Shi].   ||  [E] Bā is assumed to be a ST word related to PTB *pᵂak > WT pʰag; PLB *wak > WB wak; JP waɁ³¹ ‘pig’ (STC no. 43; Matisoff LL 1.2: 2000: 157f). But the OC and TB forms are phonologically not very close. OC medial *r corresponds also to a TB pre-initial, but TB forms for ‘pig’ do not have one, therefore one needs to assume some kind of CH innovation which led to medial *r. An OC open syllable corresponding to TB final -k is not common (§6.9). Alternatively, MK-Wa-Lawa-Bulang *bras ‘wild boar’ is semantically and phonologically close to the OC form. CH -> Miao languages npa⁴, npua⁴ ‘pig’ (Strecker LTBA 10.2, 1987: 51: Benedict, Wáng Fúshì). "
43-Toexpel,To expel,,,43-Toexpel,"  ‘To expel’ (a person) [Zhouli].  ||  [E] ST: Lushai pɔtᴸ / pɔɁᴸ ‘to pull, pull up, out’. Allofams may include → fā 發 and → fèi6 廢 ‘cast aside’ (if derived from fā)."
44-Uprooted,Uprooted,,,44-Uprooted,"  ‘Uprooted’ 沛 [Shi], ‘thinned out’ (trees) 拔 [Shi], ‘uprooted’ figuratively of a person 沛 [Lunyu].   ||  [<] exopass. of bá 犮 *bât (§4.4).  "
45-Topullupuprootbeuprooted,"To pull up, uproot, be uprooted",,,45-Topullupuprootbeuprooted,"  ‘To pull up, uproot, be uprooted’ [Yi, Shu].   ||  [<] r-caus. of bá 犮 *bât (§7.5), lit. ‘cause to be uprooted’. "
46-Rootsofgrass,Roots of grass,,,46-Rootsofgrass,"  ‘Roots of grass’ [Huainan, SW]. SW 377 considers this word related to → fā 發 ‘lift up / out’ and → fá2 伐 ‘to plow’ as the plow exposes the roots of the grass. An allofam may be → bá3 茇 ‘to camp’, and perhaps bá 跋 ‘foot, base’.  ||  [E] Etymology not clear. Comparanda may include TB-JP (n³¹-/niŋ³¹-) pot³¹ ‘root; origin’; or see bá3  茇."
47-Tocampongrassland,To camp on grassland,,,47-Tocampongrassland,"  ‘To camp on grassland’ [Shi, Zuo].  ||  [E] This is likely a specialized meanings of a MK etymon: MK *kɓat, *ɓat ‘grass’ (Shorto 2006 #1034). Possibly, bá2 茇 ‘roots of grass’ could be related."
48-Totrampleonwithfeettrudge,"To trample on (with feet), trudge",,,48-Totrampleonwithfeettrudge,"  ‘To trample on (with feet), trudge’ [Shi], ‘foot, base’ (of a torch) [Li]; ‘the end of an arrow’ [Shi]. Possibly related to bá2 茇 ‘roots (of grass)’, but that would be rather strained."
52-Ahandful,A handful,,,52-Ahandful,"  ‘A handful’ [Guoyu], ‘grasp’ [Meng].   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR pa (上);  MGZY: suppl. ba (上) [pa])  ||  [E] ST: WT spar-ba ‘the grasping hand, paw, claw, a handful’ (Unger Hao-ku 35, 1986: 36). Matisoff (2000: 155f) connects this word with PTB *r-pa-k ‘palm / sole and leaf’. For the r-metathesis, see §7.7.3.  ||  This word may be related to → pá2, bá 耙杷 ‘rake’. Given its TB cognates, it is prob. not related to → fú3 扶 ‘breadth of two fingers’. Wáng Lì (1982: 173) relates this wf to → bǐng2 秉 ‘grasp’."
54-Flatvalley,Flat valley,,,54-Flatvalley,"  ‘Flat valley’. This word from SW China is a Tai loan: S. paaᴮ¹ < *paᴮ  ‘meadow’ (Li F. 1976: 46; Mei Tsu-lin, AAS 1980). "
55-Tostopcease,"To stop, cease",,,55-Tostopcease,"  ‘To stop, cease’ (work etc.) tr. [Lun]. Prob. not related to → bì25 畢.  ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR ba (去); MGZY pay (上) [baj]  ||  [E] ST: WB priᴮ < preᴮ ‘be done, completed’ (CVST 1: 59), perh. also JP pʰraɁ³¹ < pʰrak³¹ ‘to complete’. "
57-Bewhite,Be white,,,57-Bewhite,"  ‘Be white’ [OB, BI, Shi] always has been a basic color term (Baxter JCLTA 19, 1983), also applied to silver.   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR bəj (入); LR bəjɁ; MGZY pay (入) [baj]; ONW bëk  ||  [N] The graph represents an acorn, note the element 白 in the original graphs for → lè 樂 = lì 櫟 ‘oak’ and zào 皂 ‘acorn’. It is not clear why the graph has been selected for ‘white’. (Unger Hao-ku  29, 1984).  ||  [E] ST: Most plausibly, bái is a CH kēxtension (§6.1) of the ST root *bar ‘white’ and thus cognate to → pó3 皤 ‘white’ (so Wáng Lì 1982: 292), hence OC < *bar-k: PTB *pwaːr > Lushai vaarᴴ ‘be white, light’, PKaren *Ɂ(b)wa ‘white’ (Matisoff LL 1.2, 2000: 145).  ||  Tai: S. pʰiak < *pʰr/l- ? ‘white, albino’ (Li F. 1976: 44) may be a CH loan. <> AA ‘silver’ may be related: Nyah Kur prak, PVM *prak.  ||  Alternatively, note this area word for ‘white’ without medial r which is, however, difficult to reconcile with MC: MK *kɓɔɔk ‘white, gray’ (Shorto 2006 #369a); PTB *bok (?): S. Kuki bok ‘white’, Garo gibok ~ gipok, Dimasa *g-pʰuk.    ||  [C] Possible cognates are → bó1 伯 ‘elder’; → bó2 帛; → pò4 魄, → pò5 霸魄.   ||  (bái2)  白     ||  [D] Min: Fúzhōu paiɁ⁷, Amoy bat⁷ ‘to know’, borrowed from AA: Viet biẽt ‘to know, recognize’, also PMY *p¹ai¹ᴬ ‘to know’ (Norman / Mei 1976: 298). "
58-Hundred,Hundred,,,58-Hundred,"  ‘Hundred’ [BI, Shi]. The OB graph is similar to, but not identical with, → bái1 白 ‘white’ (Unger Hao-ku  29, 1984).   ||  [T] Sin S. SR pəj (入), LR pəjɁ; MGZY bay (入) [paj]; ONW pëk.  ||  [E] ST *(p)rya: PTB *r-ya (STC no. 164) > WT brgya < br-ya; Kanauri rā; PLB *hrya, WB əra (inscriptional rya), Lushai zaᴸ-biR < jaɁ/h, Paangkhua razáa < rya. For the final -k, see §6.1. CH -> PTai *p-: Lóngzhōu paakᴰ¹ᴸ is obviously a CH loan (otherwise we should expect an r in the initial and almost certainly an open syllable).  "
59-Toopen,To open,,,59-Toopen,"  ‘To open’ [Guiguzi].   ||  [E] ST *prai: WB praiᴮ ‘to gape, expand, flare’ ᛝ pʰraiᴮ ‘to pull open, make gap’; Chepang pre-Ɂak-sa ‘to separate’ (intr.).  ||  A derivation is → bò3 擘 (pɛk). Possibly related to → zhā 奓 *trai ‘to open’. For an overview of similar items, see the table under → pí7 罷疲. For a listing of similar words and possible allofams, see → lí10 離. "
60-Toruindestroy,"To ruin, destroy",,,60-Toruindestroy,"  ‘To ruin, destroy’ [Shi].   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR pai, bai (去);  MGZY  bay, pay (去) [paj ~ bɑj]  ||  [E] Etymology not certain, but Tai: S. prap⁴ ‘to subdue, conquer’ is the same etymon and indicates a PCH form *praps > OCM *prâts. (The phonetic → bèi2 貝 is also connected to foreign -p). The direction of borrowing is undetermined, yet Tai is prob. not the ultimate source of CH. More likely, the etymon is a ‘medial r’ causative derivation (§7.5) with the addition of the redundant exoactive final *-s (§4.3). AA is the most likely source of OC: OMon pop /pop/ ‘to give way to’, Khmer -pap /-bɑɑp/ ‘be beaten, subdued, routed’ ᛝ paṁpapa /bɑmbɑɑp/ ‘to crush’ (opposition), ‘break down’ (resistance). (Note that MK has a causative r-infix). <> ST: WT ’brab-pa ‘to beat, scourge (e.g. with thorns), scatter’ (e.g. grain for offering) is semantically somewhat removed.   ||  Alternatively, bài may be derived from → fèi6 廢 ‘reject, fall’; however, fèi6 廢 ᛝ fá 乏 = WT bab ‘fall down’ is semantically different from bài 敗 = AA pap ‘be beaten’, hence we consider these two distinct wfs. Acc. to Wáng Lì (1982: 500) an allofam is → bì10 敝弊斃 ‘worn out’. Pulleyblank (1962: 215) relates this wf to → pí7 罷疲. See → fèi6 廢 for additional comments."
61-Togotoruindefeat,"To go to ruin, defeat",,,61-Togotoruindefeat,"  ‘To go to ruin, defeat’ [OB, Shi].  ||  [<] endopass. of bài 敗 (paiᶜ) (§4.6). "
62-Tobendorputtogether,To bend or put together,,,62-Tobendorputtogether,"  ‘To bend or put together’ (the hands in salute), ‘to salute’ [BI, Shi]. Etymology not clear."
63-Finerice,Fine rice,,,63-Finerice,"  ‘Fine rice’ [Shi].  ||  [E] This etymon is close to → lì21 糲 *ras ‘coarse grain’ and its possible cognates, both hail perh. from the some foreign source. This word bài and → mǐ1 米 ‘rice’ can on occasion be connected with the same foreign comparandum. The following items look similar to bài: AA-Kharia pɛɁ, Khmer paj < *paih, *pih ‘rice’, PNB *pʰe ‘husked rice’. Note also TB-Mru rai ‘a species of rice’, Lushai ṭaiF < traih (< *-s) ‘species of early rice’ [Löffler 1966: 132]; the Lushai word has also been associate with WT kʰre ‘millet’ (Sagart ms 2002: 8).

In HST: 65, the WT item is associated with → bàn2, biàn  釆, and with → bàn1 半 by Bodman (1980: 147), while Karlgren (1933: 92f) combines all of these into one wf (no. 26-37). <> AA has an alternative comparandum which is semantically closer to OC, even the initial *p- could represent an AA trans. / caus. prefix: Khmer rāla /ríiəl/  intr. ‘to spread, extend, distribute’ ᛝ brāla /príiəl/  tr. ‘to spread’.  ||  A cognate is prob. *(C-)ral → lí10 離 *rai with the occasional ST *-l > OC *-i shift (§8.3). → bān2 斑 is perh. the same word.

A kukäl, Tocharian B kokale, note Greek k´ykla or k´ykloi (‘wheels’:) ‘wagon’ [Pokorny IG etym. Wörterbuch I: 640]; an older variant survives in Northern Mand. gū-lū ‘wheel’ (so Bauer). Alternatively, acc. to Baxter / Sagart (1998: 48) chē is a derivation by k-prefix from → yú11 舁譽 ‘lift up’ (§5.4); note the WT semantic parallel tʰeg-pa ‘vehicle, carriage, riding beast’ < id. ‘to lift, raise, hold, support’."

For a similar phonological doublet, note → chǔ3 處 ~  jū2 居. Different readings of 車 are discussed by Baxter (1992: 480; 862 n. 356). Shìmíng states that the reading in MC -jwo is the older one; this is prob. based on a scribal error in a Shījīng version (Baxter 1992: 360; 480). On the other hand, Baxter points out that therefore the reading MC kjwo may be a lexicographical ghost, while a reading MC kʰjwo mentioned in JDSW seems closer to MC tśʰja with its aspiration.

743-Skull,Skull,,,743-Skull,"  ‘Skull’ [Zhuang, GY]. Li Fang Kuei (1976: 44) who relates this word to Tai: S. (kra-) duukᴰ¹ᴸ < *-Ɂdl/ruok (actually *Ɂluok ?), considers this a reduplication from a hypothetical OC *dlug. This bisyllabic word appears in more variants (tóu-lú  頭顱 and dú-lú  頓顱).  ||  [E] These variants are partially composed of syllables meaning ‘head’ (tóu) of ST stock (Loloish languages have cognates in compound words for ‘head’: Matisoff 1978: 64). Dú 髑 is a ST item which is prob. related to → dòu5 脰 ‘neck’: PTB *du(k) ‘neck, skull’ > Abor-Miri a-tuk, Atong dək-əm, Kaike tʰoppā (< tʰok-pa) ‘head’ (Matisoff ibid. p. 65). One may speculate that the second syllable is related to lóu 婁 [lo] with a hypothetical meaning ‘empty’ or ‘dried’, hence lit. ‘dried head’ as in Lushai. More likely, though, the second part is a reduplication syllable starting with *r/*l (§2.7). Similar-looking items include → lú4 顱; AA-Khmer rɔliə ‘shell, skull’ (from earlier rɔ-laː ?). "
744-Skull,Skull,,,744-Skull,"  ‘Skull’ [Guoce]. This form is reminiscent of Lushai luF-roᴴ ‘skull’ (lit. ‘dried head’) and luF-ruɁᴸ ‘skull’ (lit. ‘head-bone’), just as in CH the first syllable is ‘head’. "

This late form seems to be the s. w. as dú-lóu above, but committed to writing when OC *a had become more back like *ɑ or *o. An additional MC variant is ṭɐk- / ṭʰɐk- [GY] which seems close to KS words for ‘bone’: *tlaːk⁷ (Thurgood) or *k-laːkᴰ (Edmondson/Yang); yet these latter have entered Chinese as → gé5 骼 ‘bone’. "

764-Mound,Mound,,,764-Mound,"  ‘Mound’ [Chuci].  ||  [E] The first textual appearance in Chǔcí suggests a foreign word. MK has several roots with the meaning ‘hill, mound’: MK *dul ‘hill’ (Shorto 2006 #1741), and MK *bt1u[u]l, *bt1uəl ‘swelling, mound, hill’ (Shorto 2006 #1738); OKhmer dul ‘to bulge’, OKhmer /duuəl/ ‘knoll, hillock, mound’, PVM *dolᴬ ‘hill’, PSBahn. *tul ~ *nətul ‘anthill’.

785-Manyall,"Many, all",,,785-Manyall,"  ‘Many, all’, forms plurals, especially for persons to whom respect is due [BI, Shi]. Zhū replaced earlier OB duō 多 in this sense, e.g. OB  duō yǐn 多尹 ‘all the administrators’ [OB Yib. 867] > 諸尹 [BI]. In BI both duō and zhū occur. Subsequently in Shījīng, duō is rare in the sense ‘all’, zhū becomes the norm: zhū hóu 諸侯 ‘all the feudal lords’ [Shi 6,34]. Therefore, it is conceivable that zhū had branched off from duō 多 (tâ) *tlai in the sense ‘all’ as the pre-nominal proclitic adjectival use, due to the loss of final *-i in *tlai 多 in this position, hence *tlai winɁ 多尹 > *tla winɁ > *ta winɁ (Baxter acc. to Matisoff 1995a: 54). Alternatively, Karlgren (1956: 17) connects zhū with the wf → zhǔ6 貯褚 ‘collect’; Graham (1973: 294ff) considers zhū a dependent (‘non-adjunctive’) pronoun.  "
787-Bemanyabundant,"Be many, abundant",,,787-Bemanyabundant,"  ‘Be many, abundant’ [Shi], adj. ‘the many, all’ [BI, Shi], syn. of zhū and duō: in Shūjīng occurs shù yǐn 庶尹, for example. Thus ‘all the administrators’ can be duō yǐn 多尹, zhū yǐn 諸尹 or shù yǐn 庶尹. Given the OC phonological similarity of these three words, it is therefore likely that shù is cognate to duō; the initial can be explained as a devoiced *lh- (§5.5) after loss of the *t- which was felt to be some sort of pre-initial."

Acc. to W. Eberhard (1968: 43-50), the dog play a significant role in Yáo mythology.

1367-Beextensive,Be extensive,,,1367-Beextensive,"  ‘Be extensive’ [Shi, Shu]; the Shījīng rime indicates tone A, hence it is perh. not a graphic loan for guàng 廣 (kuâŋᶜ) ‘fully, extensively’ (so Karlgren GSR 707a). Karlgren (1956: 14) adds:"

Although the morphological role of the initial k- is not clear (but a k-prefix does occur, see §5.4), guī is prob. derived from → huí 回; see there for an overview of synonyms.

It may be related to either WB kwak ‘a circle or round spot..., confined within a local area’ (as rain); or alternatively to WT yul ‘country’. One could perh. connect the latter with yòu: WT initial y- can have dissimilated from ST *wu (§12.9[2]); the addition of the Chinese final *-k (§6.1) has preempted the putative ST final *-l; however, invoking too many rare correspondence patterns deminishes the likelihood of such an etymology.

Semai (Aslian branch of MK) lwey [All forms from Matisoff 1995a]. Note that none of the TB forms cited by Matisoff and in STC no. 157 have a medial r or l (HST: 41). Therefore the bisyllabic OC form is not the result of dimidiation, but simply a reduplicative compound of the common type CV-lV or *CV-rV (§2.7). "
1397-Topass,To pass,,,1397-Topass,"  ‘To pass’ [Shi], ‘transgress’ [Lunyu], derived from guō next (Unger Hao-ku 21, 1983: 175).  ||  [E] Prob.

In OC they were (near?) homophones in spite of the difference in MC medial w. Semantic parallelism with → míng3 溟冥 ‘ocean’ = → míng2 冥 ‘dark’ supports this etymological connection. "
1403-Bonelessmeatsauce,Boneless meat sauce,,,1403-Bonelessmeatsauce,"  ‘Boneless meat sauce’ [Shi], or ‘meat which has been dried, minced and pickled’ (GSR 995n). Bodman (1980: 133) compares this to WT smig ‘purple, color of clotted blood’, smug-ma ‘stale meat, getting rotten’ [Das].  "
1404-pig,pig,,,1404-pig,"  The 12th of the Earthly Branches identified with the pig [OB] (the graph is the drawing of a pig), acc. to Norman (1985: 89) a loan from AA, note Viet. g≥oi ‘pig’ (obsolete), Khmer kol (sp. ko[r]) ‘pig’ (in names of years).  "

Furthermore, Wáng Lì (1982: 605) believes it to be related to → qiǎn3 慊 ‘dissatisfied’. Perh. → dàn5 啖啗 is somehow connected with this root. "

1416-Sweat,Sweat,,,1416-Sweat,"  ‘Sweat’ [Yi]. TB has similar looking words, note PKiranti *gʰàl ‘sweat’ (Starostin acc. to van Driem 1995: 254), or Lushai tʰlanᴸ ‘sweat’ [Weidert 1975: 19].  "
1419-Nameofariver,Name of a river,,,1419-Nameofariver,"  ‘Name of a river’ in the ancient Chǔ area, can also mean ‘river’ generally as in ‘Milky way’ [Shi]. The right element in the graph was probably not phonetic, hence the initial did not include an *n. "
1420-Toscorch,To scorch,,,1420-Toscorch,"  ‘To scorch’ [Shi].  ||  [E] The phonology and hence etymology is not certain. Prob. not related to → rán1 然 *nan ‘burn’ because the phonetic element in hàn has originally been chosen for its meaning ‘distress’, not for its sound (so GSR 144). Baxter apparently considers 熯 a graphic loan for a word OCB *njanɁ. The difference in the initial consonants (*h- vs. *k-) makes cognation with the syn. → gān9 乾 unlikely. "
1421-Toburn,To burn,,,1421-Toburn,"  ‘To burn’ [Guan], ‘dry’ [Yi]. "
1429-stretchtheneck,stretch the neck,,,1429-stretchtheneck,"  Occurs in Shi 28 together with jié 頡 (jié... háng); SW glosses both ‘stretch the neck’, this word is thus perh. a variant of → xiàng4 項, and derived from → gāng1 亢 (kâŋ) ‘neck’. On the other hand, commentators interpret these words as ‘flying up and flying down’ (of birds)."
1430-Gobyboat,Go by boat,,,1430-Gobyboat,"  ‘Go by boat’ 杭 [Shi], ‘boat’ 航 [GY], 枇 [SW]. Whereas acc. to Yìjīng a → zhōu1 舟‘boat’ was originally a hollowed tree trunk (canoe), háng was two boats combined into one, as canoes lashed together (so SW, although Liú Yǐ-gāng YYYJ 1986.1: 169 thinks a háng was probably constructed of boards). Acc. to FY, háng is used for zhōu 舟 east of the Passes. "
1431-AncientWuwordsforboat,Ancient Wú words for boat,,,1431-AncientWuwordsforboat,"  ‘Ancient Wú words for boat’ [Yupian] are variants acc. to Mahdi (1994: 456). Egerod (CAAAL 6, 1976: 58) believes that this is the same etymon as → xíng1 行 ‘to go to’, but it prob. has an AN origin (via AA?) *qaBaŋ ‘two boats lashed together’ (Mahdi 1999: 147f). → fāng2 方 is prob. the same etymon.

1442-Vast,Vast,,,1442-Vast,"  ‘Vast’ of rising waters [Shi]. The etymology of the homophone hào 顥 [Lü], 昊 [Shi] (Ɣâuᴮ) is ambiguous because it can mean ‘bright, splendid’ (of Heaven) and then be the s. w. as → hào2 皓.  ||  [E] A TB cognate is perh. WB koᴮ ‘rise up, swell, bulge’ ᛝ ko ‘lift out of place, prize up’, Lushai koᴴ ‘raised ground, mound, rise suddenly’ (waters), ‘surge’ (waves). Hào may be an allofam of → gāo1 高 ‘high’, although the vowels do not agree. "
1444-Todrink,To drink,,,1444-Todrink,"  ‘To drink’ 欱 [Ban Gu, Han dyn.] is cognate to, or a popular variant of, xī 用 LH  xiəp ‘to drink’ [Hou Hanshu] (Baxter, p.c.) and perh. also to → xiá1 呷. It may be of ST origin: Lushai hupᴸ ‘to drink from the hands, suck (water) from hand’.  "

1527-Dewlapofananimal,Dewlap of an animal,,,1527-Dewlapofananimal,"  ‘Dewlap of an animal’ (which hangs down from the chin) [Shi, SW] > ‘beard’ 鬍 [Han texts] (Wáng Lì 1982: 144). Acc. to Boltz (OE 35, 1992: 37); this word is cognate to kū 枯 ‘desiccated’ and ultimately to → gù1 固 ‘solid’. "
1528-Steppenomads,Steppe nomads,,,1528-Steppenomads,"  ‘Steppe nomads’, general term [Zhouli] (Pulleyblank EC 25, 2000: 20), etymology unknown. "
1532-Butterfly,Butterfly,,,1532-Butterfly,"  ‘Butterfly’ [Zhuang].  ||  [E] ST: The TB forms vary: Lepcha ha-kljóp ‘a species of butterfly, Buprestis bicolor’, WT pʰje-ma-leb < pem-a-lep. The second syllable *lêp belongs either to the wf → dié 牒; or to PTB *lyap ‘glitter, flash’, see → yè6 燁. (Yan Xiuhong ZGYW 2, 2002: 154 has an extensive discussions of húdié). "
1533-Butterfly,Butterfly,,,1533-Butterfly,"  ‘Butterfly’ [Yupian] is a variant of húdié (Bodman). The first syllable is glossed ‘butterfly’ in SW, it survives in Y-Guǎngzhōu kapᴰ¹ ‘butterfly’, -> Jap. kai < *kapi (Bodman 1980: 146)."

1540-Tiger,Tiger,,,1540-Tiger,"  ‘Tiger’ [OB, Shi]. The name of this dangerous animal is subject to taboo. It was there-fore apt to be replaced by a different word, or at least undergo some modification. One way is to add a prefix or word which indicates respect, hence Mand. lǎo-hǔ 老虎 ‘old (= venerable) tiger’; the prefix yú < *Ɂa in yú-tù etc. served the same purpose in the OC dialect word, see below and → ā 阿. The other method is to distort the pronunciation by using a dialect word as in hǔ whose phonology indicates a possible rural or vulgar origin (voiceless *lh- > MC x-, §5.6).  ||  [D] The regular OC equivalent of foreign *kl- is expected to be a voiceless *lh- > MC śj- or tʰ-. Such forms are found in old dialects (Pulleyblank 1983: 427): (1) yú-tù 於菟(Ɂjwo-tʰuoᶜ) [Ɂiɑ-tʰɑh] OCM *Ɂa-lhâk is a Chǔ dialect word recorded in the 5th cent. BC Zuǒzhuàn. The Hòu Hànshū has a variant yú-shì 於瑙  (Ɂjwo-śjäk) [Ɂiɑ-śiak] OCM *Ɂa-lhak. The FY has a further graphic variant yú-tù 於睚 to which Guō Pú adds that south of the Yangtze, the pronunciation of tù is like gǒu-d`ou 苟竇 (kəuᴮ-dəuᶜ), i.e. a hypothetical OCM *kôɁ-lôh which comes close to AA forms.  ||  Some modern interior Min dialects have *kʰoᴮ, but the stop feature is prob. secondary.  ||  [E] PAA *kalaɁ ‘tiger’ > PMK *klaɁ (Shorto 2006 #197) > OKhm *klaa (> later Angkorian Khm. khlaa; -> Tai: S. kla²), PMonic *klaaɁ [Diffloth 1984], Munda kula, Kharia ki’ÂɔɁ (Norman a.

It is tempting to derive 戶 from → hù3 互枑 ‘barrier’, yet the latter agree more closely with a different TB etymon (Lushai kʰaar). "

This could be the s. w. as hù 扈 ‘to stop, prevent’ [Zuo], but is prob. unrelated to → hù1 戶’door’.  ||  Both tone B words hù 滬 and gǔ 罟may be nominal derivations from hù 互."

1553-Flower,Flower,,,1553-Flower,"  ‘Flower’, originally a noun (see Wáng Lì 1982: 142 for a discussion of this wf). The graph (whose OC rime should be *-ai) has been borrowed for an etymon in OC *-a).  ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR xwa (平); MGZY hwa (平) [xwa]; ONW xuä  ||  [E] TB languages often alternate initial labial stops *p, *b with *w, also in the root for ‘blossom, flower’ *bar (→ pā 葩, → bàn 瓣) (Matisoff LL 1.2, 2000: 144-146). Huā may be an example of the ST *bar ~ *war variation (for the metathesis of the final *r, see §7.7.3). Alternatively, note AA-OKhmer /pkaa/ ‘flower’; the complex AA initial might have been the reason for the CH development. "
1554-Tobeinflower,To be in flower,,,1554-Tobeinflower,"  ‘To be in flower’ intr. > blossom, flower’ [Shi], originally a vb. (Wáng Lì). "

1562-Paintedwithadesign,"Painted, with a design",,,1562-Paintedwithadesign,"  ‘Painted, with a design’ adj. [BI, Shu] > ‘to draw a design, depict’ [Meng].   ||  [T] MGZY Xway (去) [Ɣwaj]; ONW Ɣuä  ||  [<] exopass. of huò 畫 (*wek) (§4.4).  ||  [E] MK: OKhmer gur ~ gvar ‘to draw a line, make a drawing’ [S.

The vocalic discrepancy has parallels, see §11.1.3. "
1563-Todelineatemarkoffplan,"To delineate, mark off, plan",,,1563-Todelineatemarkoffplan,"  ‘To delineate, mark off, plan’ [Zuo].   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR Ɣuj (入); MGZY Xway (入) [Ɣwaj]"

1582-Blood,Blood,,,1582-Blood,"  ‘Blood’ [Zuo, Xi Gong 15, quoting Yi 54,6]. This rare word’s occurrence in a traditional saying indicates that it is not part of the active vocabulary of OC, but a survival from a substrate language.  ||  [E] MK *jhaam, *jhiim ‘blood’ (Shorto 2006 #1430): PNorth Bahnaric *maham, PMnong *mham, Asli maham (Benjamin 1976: 103), Khmu maːm < *mh-; without m-infix: PVM *Ɂa-saːmɁ, Khmer jham, PMonic *chim, Katuic *Ɂə(ŋ)haːm, Mundari ma˜jɔm.

The OC initial was probably a voiceless *m- which can derived from, among others, a prehistoric cluster with either *h or *s. "
1586-Beauguststately,"Be august, stately",,,1586-Beauguststately,"  ‘Be august, stately’ [BI, Shi], ‘royal, imperial’.  ||  [E] Etymology not certain, possibly originally meaning ‘royal’ (derived from ‘royal palace’), belonging to the AA etyma *waŋ under → yíng4 營. Tai luaŋ ‘royal’ is a loan from Khmer (h)luːəŋ ‘king, royal’. This word may early have converged with the homophone → huáng2 煌 ‘brilliant’. Bodman 1980: 107 connects huáng with → wáng2 王 ‘king’. "
1587-Bebrilliantsplendidmagnificent,"Be brilliant, splendid, magnificent",,,1587-Bebrilliantsplendidmagnificent,"  ‘Be brilliant, splendid, magnificent’ 煌 > ‘brown and white’ (of a horse) 皇 [BI, Shi]. Perh. → huáng1 皇 is the same word; → guāng1 光 ‘bright’. "
1588-Beyellowbrown,"Be yellow, brown",,,1588-Beyellowbrown,"  ‘Be yellow, brown’ [OB, Shi] is one of the ancient basic color terms (Baxter 1983).   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR Ɣwaŋ (平); MGZY Xong (平) [Ɣɔŋ]; ONW Ɣuɑŋ  ||  [E] ST: WB waŋᴮ ‘brightly yellow’ ᛝ wa ‘yellow’.  "

Alternatively, the word may be related to TB-Lushai muutF / muɁ ‘to smolder’. "
1593-Flamebrightness,"Flame, brightness",,,1593-Flamebrightness,"  ‘Flame, brightness’ 煇 [Yi]; ‘light, brightness’ 暉 [Yi]; ‘bright’ 輝 [Meng].  ||  Perh. yùn  煇 (juənᶜ)  LH  wunᶜ, OCM  *wəns  ||  ‘Brightness’ [Zhouli] (Wáng Lì 1982: 508f); ‘halo’ [Lü] could either be the same etymon, or be related to → yùn2 運暈 ‘revolve’.

Downer (1959: 285) reads ‘go around, go by way of’ in tone C which implies an ‘effective’ meaning.  ||  [C] Allofams are → guī3 歸 ‘return’; → wéi6 違 ‘turn against’ from which huí is derived.  ||  [E] Many CH and TB words for ‘round, turn’ look similar. Most have initial *w- and foreign final -n, -l, -r, or -i, and therefore they are difficult to sort out, so that Bodman, Karlgren, Wáng Lì and other investigators have connected them in different ways. The merger of earlier final *-l and *-r into either OC *-n or *-i makes it impossible at the moment to find a rational way of associating foreign with OC items:   ||  (1) OC *-wan > MC rime -uan, -jwɐn / -jwän < OC *-uan, *-wan, *-on can derive from earlier ST or foreign -wan, -war, -wal, -(w)on, -(w)or, -(w)ol; given the latitude of sound correspondences, the vowels could in some words even have been e or u, beside a and o.

1612-Can,Can,,,1612-Can,"  ‘Can’, aux. vb. expressing potentiality [Tang], later replaced by the above huì. It is not clear if this and the above word are variants or cognates, but their similarity is suggestive. This word survives in M-Jiànyáng haiᶜ, Fúzhōu aᶜ², Xiàmén ueᶜ². "
1614-Topresentassignvaluablesdowry,"To present, assign, valuables, dowry",,,1614-Topresentassignvaluablesdowry,"  ‘To present, assign, valuables, dowry’ [BI, Shi]. The earlier phonetic was měi 每 *mə̂Ɂ, hence the OCM form (Schuessler 1987: 257; Baxter 1992: 352), but the word might have changed to *hwəɁ under the influence of yòu 侑 *wəh ‘to offer’ (under → yǒu2 有).  "
1615-Toinstruct,To instruct,,,1615-Toinstruct,"  ‘To instruct’ [BI, Shi] is related to → mǔ3 姆 ‘teacher’.    ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR xuj (去); MGZY hue (去) [xuɛ]  ||  [E] ST: PL *s-ma² ‘to teach’; CVST 1: 26 adds WT smo-ba, smos ‘to say’.  "
1616-Bedarkdarkness,"Be dark, darkness",,,1616-Bedarkdarkness,"  ‘Be dark, darkness’ (of sky, clouds) > metaphorical ‘dark’ [Shi], ‘night time’ (vs. míng 明 ‘day time’) [Guoyu], ‘last day of the lunar month’ [Chunqiu]. Shījīng rimes indicate tone B (Mattos 1971: 309).  ||  [E] Prob. MK: OKhmer kmval /kmuuəl/ ‘be cloudy, overcast, dark, beclouded, be as black as a cloud’. For the absence of final *-l in CH after a MK long vowel, see §6.9. Since the word refers primarily to meteorological and natural conditions, and seems to be related to a synonymous and (mutatis mutandis) homophonous MK etymon, it is prob. not related to ST → méi9 煤 ‘soot’, → hēi 黑 ‘black’, → mén3 悶 ‘unconsciously’. A cognate is prob. → hǎi1 海 ‘ocean’. "
1617-Categoryclass,"Category, class",,,1617-Categoryclass,"  ‘Category, class’ [Yi], ‘numerous’ [Shi]. If related to → lèi2 類, this may perh. be a form which has treated the initial *r as a prefix and dropped it (§10.1.3). The same graph huì also writes → huì9 彙 ‘porcupine’ which has possibly a similar variant in the initial. "
1618-Porcupine,Porcupine,,,1618-Porcupine,"  ‘Porcupine’ [SW]. The same graph also writes a word → huì8 彙 ‘category’ which is perh. a variant of a word with initial l-: → lèi2 類 (§10.1.3).  ||  [E] Perhaps from MK *[r]kus, *[r]kuus, *[r]kuəs, *[r]k[iə]s ‘porcupine’ (Shorto 2006 #1883; p.33) >  Lushai kuɁᴸ < kus ‘porcupine, quill of a p.’ In CH the foreign initial k was perhaps ignored as a prefix. Cantonese has the curious form lœyᶜ² (Bodman 1980: 89). "
1619-Beardofchin,Beard of chin,,,1619-Beardofchin,"  ‘Beard of chin’ 顪 [Zhuang], GY also: ‘jiá 頰 jaw, cheek’; ‘snout’ 喙 [Zuo; JDSW xjwɐiᶜ], ‘mouth’ [SW] (the last graph has additional readings which prob. belong to the meaning ‘to pant’). For MC x-, see §5.6. The meanings of these homophonous graphs slide gradually into each other (‘jaw’ written with ‘beard’), therefore this seems to be one etymon, although ‘beard’ might have entered OC via KT (note the identical meanings), while ‘snout’ might have been inherited from ST, unless it is a TB loan. For semantics, note that a ‘schnauzer’ is not noted for its snout (which all dogs have), but for its striking mustache.  ||  [E] KT: S. nuatᴰ¹ᴸ < *hn- ‘beard’ which appears to have come ultimately from some Burmese-like TB lg.: WB hnut ‘mouth, womb’, used in composits for ‘beard’. Since there is no hint of a nasal initial in OC, Tai is unlikely to have been the borrower. Huì seems to be related in a roundabout way to → xū4 須鬚, see there for more TB cognates. "
1622-Relationsbymarriagewifeinlaws,"Relations by marriage, wife, in-laws",,,1622-Relationsbymarriagewifeinlaws,"  ‘Relations by marriage, wife, in-laws’ [BI, Shi]; ‘wife’s father’ [EY, Zuo], ‘wife’s family’ [SW]; hūn-yīn 婚姻 ‘relatives’ [Shi], ‘marriage’ [Li]. Wáng Lì (1982: 508) quotes from Han-period literature: ‘wedding’ is called hūn because the ceremony takes place at dusk hūn 昏 (under → mén3 悶) [SW, Shiming, Baihu tong], but this looks like a folk etymology. One may speculate instead that hūn ‘dark’ signifies ‘female’, like its synonym → yīn5 陰 ‘dark’. "
1626-Spiritualsoul,Spiritual soul,,,1626-Spiritualsoul,"  ‘Spiritual soul’ [Zuo] as opposed to → pò4 魄 ‘animal soul’. Since pò is the ‘bright’ soul, hún is the ‘dark’ soul and therefore cognate to → yún5 雲 ‘cloud’ (Carr, CAAAL 24, 1985: 62), perhaps in the sense of ‘shadowy’ because some believe that the hún soul will live after death in a world of shadows (Wolfram Eberhard Guilt and Sin in ancient China, 1967: 17). "
1628-Chaos,Chaos,,,1628-Chaos,"  ‘Chaos’ 混 [Lao], ‘muddled, confused’ 渾 [Lao], ‘abundantly flowing’ 混 [Meng] (some commentators also read LH kuənᴮ 混). "
1629-Disturbedtroubledby,"Disturbed, troubled by",,,1629-Disturbedtroubledby,"  ‘Disturbed, troubled by’ [Zuo] > ‘troubled, disorderly’ 溷 [Chuci] > ‘suffer, grief’ 慁 [Guoce]. "
1630-Soundofrunningwater,Sound of running water,,,1630-Soundofrunningwater,"  ‘Sound of running water’ [Xun], ‘chaotic’ [Zhuang]. A variant is apparently → hóng3 訌 LH goŋ ‘disorderly, trouble’. "
1631-Bedistressed,Be distressed,,,1631-Bedistressed,"  ‘Be distressed’ [Shu], ‘distress, exhaust’ [Zuo], ‘fatigue’ [Li].  ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR k'un (去); MGZY khun (去) [k'un]; ONW kʰon  ||  [E] Perh. related to Mand. kùn 睏 ‘sleepy’. Alternatively, this word may be derived from → kùn1 困 ‘obstruct’ [Yi], as emotions are often expressed by concrete notions, but this is not likely in light of hùn 溷慁 above. HST: 63 related this word to WT kʰur ‘burden, load’. A further cognate may be → jiǒng4 窘 in which case this and the doublet of hún point to a PCH final *-uŋ. "
1634-Tokeepalivelife,"To keep alive, life",,,1634-Tokeepalivelife,"  ‘To keep alive, life’ [Shi] has prob. nothing to do with ‘moist’ (so GSR 302m) because this graph with the water radical was prob. intended to write guō 活 (kuât) LH kuɑt ‘to purl’ (as running water) [Shi]. The etymology is possibly AA: Wa-Lawa-Bulang *gɑs ‘alive’ (of plants), Aslian languages gɔs ‘to live’. "
1635-Fire,Fire,,,1635-Fire,"  ‘Fire’ [OB, Shi].   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR xwɔ (上); MGZY hwo (上) [xwɔ]; ONW huɑ "

The relationship with → huī6 墮隳, if any, is not clear (dialect? convergence?). "
1637-Many,Many,,,1637-Many,"  ‘Many’, an old Han-period dial. word in the outlying areas of Qí and Sòng and in the region between Chǔ and Wèi [FY 1.21]. It survives in Mǐn dialects: PMin *oiᶜ ~ *uaiᴮ  ‘many’ (Norman 1983: 204). "
1639-Todeceivedelusiondoubt,"To deceive, delusion, doubt",,,1639-Todeceivedelusiondoubt,"  ‘To deceive, delusion, doubt’ [Lun]. Etymology not clear. "
1640-Tobind,To bind,,,1640-Tobind,"  ‘To bind’ [Zhuang].  ||  [E] ST: WT ’grogs-pa ‘to bind, fasten, tie, be associated with’ ᛝ grogs ‘friend, associate’ (HST p. 42). "
1641-Toreapcutharvest,"To reap, cut, harvest",,,1641-Toreapcutharvest,"  ‘To reap, cut, harvest’ [Shi], Mand. also ‘capture’. "
1642-Tocatchtakehitsucceed,"To catch, take, hit, succeed",,,1642-Tocatchtakehitsucceed,"  ‘To catch, take, hit, succeed’ [Shi]. "
1643-Atrap,A trap,,,1643-Atrap,  ‘A trap’ [Shu] – an early general tone C derivation of the above (§3.5).   ||  [C] This wf may be related to → jué12 攫. 
1647-Behungrystarvehungerfamine,"Be hungry, starve, hunger, famine",,,1647-Behungrystarvehungerfamine,"  ‘Be hungry, starve, hunger, famine’ [Shi].  — [T] ONW ki  — [D] PMin *kue  ||  [E] ST: WT bkres ‘be hungry’, JP kyet³¹ ‘hungry’, Lepcha krít, Chepang kray- ‘to hunger’, Mru krai (Löffler 1966: 148). A possible allofam is → jìn6 饉殣 ‘famine’. "
1648-Famine,Famine,,,1648-Famine,"  ‘Famine’ 饑饉 [Shi]. This word is distinct from jī above (Wáng Lì 1958: 550); for the difference in vowel,  see §11.7.1-2. "
1649-Todrawwater,To draw water,,,1649-Todrawwater,"  ‘To draw water’ [Yi].  ||  [E] ST: PTB *kaːp (STC no. 336): PLB *C-kap, WB kʰap ‘dig up, draw water’; Garo ko ‘draw water’; Dimasa kʰau ‘pluck, gather, draw’ (water) (HST: 66). "
1650-OddnumberYiXununiqueirregular,"Odd (number) 奇 [Yi], 畸 [Xun]; ‘unique, irregular",,,1650-OddnumberYiXununiqueirregular,"  ‘Odd (number) 奇 [Yi], 畸 [Xun]; ‘unique, irregular’ 奇 [Li].  ||  [E] This seems to be a ST etymon: WB kʰai- < kaiᴮ ‘remarkable’ (obsolete).   ||  [C] An allofam is prob. → jǐ3 掎 ‘pull aside’. Because of the  occasional *-ai ~ *-e vacillation in wfs (§11.3.3), → qǐ5 企跂 ‘stand on tiptoe’ may also be related. "
1651-Strangeextraordinary,"Strange, extraordinary",,,1651-Strangeextraordinary,"  ‘Strange, extraordinary’ [Zuo].   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR gi (平); MGZY ki (平) [gi]"
1652-Foundationbasesettlement,"Foundation, base, settlement",,,1652-Foundationbasesettlement,"  ‘Foundation, base, settlement’ [Shi].  ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR kjej (平), PR, LR ki; MGZY gi (平) [ki];   ||  [N] This can hardly be related to the TB items under → jǐ 几机, nor to Lushai keᴸ ‘foot, leg, wheel’ (→ zhī4 支枝肢) because the vowels are different.  "
1653-Winnowingbasket,Winnowing basket,,,1653-Winnowingbasket,"  ‘Winnowing basket’ [OB, Shi]. Unger (Hao-ku 38, 1992: 79) relates this word to lí 梩 (lji) ‘basket’ [Meng] and suggests a possible connection with → qǐ2 杞 ‘willow’. "

A Han dialect form of the Chén-Chǔ-Sòng area was zhī 切 (kjie 4) [kie] [FY 8, 4].  ||  [E] Area word; since its origin is onomatopoetic, phonological correspondences are not regular: PTai *kəiᴮ¹ ‘chicken’ (Li F. 1976: 42), PKS *kaːi⁵, Kadai *kiᴬ. <> PMY *kai  (Downer 1982) <> PVM *r-ka ‘chicken’ (on the vocalism, see §11.1.3). "
1656-Tocollectaccumulate,"To collect, accumulate",,,1656-Tocollectaccumulate,"  ‘To collect, accumulate’ [Shi] > ‘to block’ [Zhuang].  ||  [E] ST: WT rtseg-pa ‘to put on top, pile up, stack’. Sagart (1999: 214) suggests that possibly → cè4 冊策筴 ‘bamboo slips > document’ is related. Perh. related to → zī7 資. "
1657-Tocollectstorewealth,"To collect, store, wealth",,,1657-Tocollectstorewealth,"  ‘To collect, store, wealth’ [Shi] > ‘provisions’ [Zuo].  ||  [<] exopass. derivation (§4.4), perh. also the verbal meanings (‘be heaped’?).  "
1658-Totwistspin,"To twist, spin",,,1658-Totwistspin,"  ‘To twist, spin’ (to make thread) [Shi] > ‘achievement, result’ [Shu] is perh. an s-iterative of → xì1 係繫 *keh ‘bind, tie up’ (§5.2.3), with final -k (§6.1); yet PCH *s-k- is expected to yield MC kʰ-.  "
1659-Toascendrisethemistrises,"To ascend, rise, the mist rises",,,1659-Toascendrisethemistrises,"  ‘To ascend, rise, the mist rises’ [ Shi]."

Karlgren (1956: 5) considered this the s. w. as → jī12 幾 which is glossed as ‘small’, but jī 幾 really means ‘be imminent, close to, first sign, detail’. Instead, jī is perh. cognate to → qǐ7 綮, thus meaning originally a contraption with hinges or joints, i.e. with moveable parts. "
1666-Reachto,Reach to,,,1666-Reachto,"  ‘Reach to’ [BI, Zhuang], ‘search, research, examine, comprehend’ [Shu], ‘calculate’ [Li]; ‘divine by tortoise-shell’ 葉 [SW: Shu]; zhī 支 (tśie) [kie] ‘to calculate’ [Da Dai Liji] is prob. a variant if not simply a graphic loan. "

2138-Hole,Hole,,,2138-Hole,"  ‘Hole’ (as an opening in the flesh, between organs of a carcass) [Zhuang], ‘to hollow out’ (a piece of wood to make a box) [Hanshu]. Aspiration is associated with the meaning ‘hollow, empty’ §5.8.6.  ||  [E] ST: PTB *kwar ‘hole’ (STC no. 350) > Lushai kʰurᴴ ‘a hole, pit, cavity’ ᛝ kʰuarᴴ id., Tangkhul Naga kʰur ‘hole’.

2142-Squarebasket,Square basket,,,2142-Squarebasket,"  ‘Square basket’ > vb. ‘put into a square basket’ [Shi]; ‘get boxed in’ (in a military maneuver) [BI]; kuāng-chuáng 筐床 ‘bed’ (which is rectangular) [Zhuang] (chuáng ‘bed’). From the Yìjīng 54 line  女承筐無實 n  chéng kuāng wú shí  ‘the woman holds a basket, it has no fruit’ (implying she is barren) derives the euphemism ch´eng-kuāng ‘vagina’ (Shaugh nessy JAS 51.3, 1992: 591); this is perh. also the connotation in Shījīng 161.1.  ||  [E] A final -ŋ derivation from the stem under → jǔ3 矩 ‘square’ (§6.5.2). Alternatively, Baxter / Sagart (1998: 48) derive this word with k-prefix (§5.4) from → fāng1 方 ‘square’. If true, loss of a post-initial consonant could explain the aspiration. "
2143-Befoolishcrazy,"Be foolish, crazy",,,2143-Befoolishcrazy,"  ‘Be foolish, crazy’ [Shi]. The graph was apparently designed for ‘mad dog disease, rabies’.  — The etymology is not clear. "

Chinese kuí 夔 is a loan from a KT source: PTai *Ɣwaiᴬ ‘buffalo’ (Mei Tsu-Lin, AAS paper 1980); Sui kwiᴬ² < gwiᴬ ‘buffalo’ (Hansell 1988: 269). Note also PAN *kəbaw (Dempwolff), Tagalog kalabao, Malay kĕrbao, Fiji karavau (Benedict AT: 45; Mahdi 1994: 200). "
2154-Wildbuffalo,Wild buffalo,,,2154-Wildbuffalo,"  ‘Wild buffalo’ [Erya, Yupian]. This is not a pre-Han word.  ||  [E] This is ultimately the same etymon as kuí, but the source might have been a TB language: PTB *lwaay ‘buffalo’, JP Ɂu³³-loi³³, ŋa³³-loi³³ (ŋa³³ ‘bovine’), WB kywai < klway (STC no. 208; Matisoff 1974 no. 262).

There might have been a *-wa ~ *-wai variation already on the ST level (see → kuà 跨) because both OC and WB have these doublets.   ||  [C] This etymon may be related to → qīng4 傾頃 ‘slanting’, both are connected at least in the minds of those writers who borrowed 頃 for kuǐ [Liji].

2159-Food,Food,,,2159-Food,"  ‘Food’ 饋 [Shi], ‘to eat’ [Huainanzi] > caus. ‘to present food’ 餽饋 [Meng].   ||  [E] This word looks like a cognate of → yí12 遺 (jiwi 4) ‘hand down, present’. However, one would expect a MC div. 4 final, not the div. 3 final which is confirmed by Mand. kuì (we would expect Mand. ji or qi in div. 4 syllables of this type). Also, the meanings ‘food’ and ‘present’ suggest different etyma, the meaning ‘to present’ for both is an accidental convergence. "
2160-Elderbrother,Elder brother,,,2160-Elderbrother,"  ‘Elder brother’ [Shi].   ||  [E] Etymology is not clear. STC: 158 n. 428 relates kūn to the same PTB root *kəw ‘maternal uncle’ to which belongs → jiù2 舅. Alterna tively, note MK-MMon ko² / ko/ ‘elder brother’, CH could have added the nominal -n (§6.4.3). "
2161-Afterwards,Afterwards,,,2161-Afterwards,"  ‘Afterwards’ [Shu], 􀜝􀗺 ‘posterity’, ‘descendants’ [EY, Chuci, Shiming].  ||  [E] Since the basic CH meaning is ‘afterwards’, kūn is probably not related to MK *kuun  ||  ‘child’ (Shorto 2006 #1127): PVM *kɔ:n ‘son’, from which the Southern word → jiān1 囝 is thought to derive."

2168-Threshold,Threshold,,,2168-Threshold,"  ‘Threshold’ [Li].   ||  [<] Kǔn could be an endoactive deriv. from kùn, lit. ‘the thing that obstructs’ (§4.5.1); or conversely, kùn could be an exoactive deriv. from kǔn, lit. ‘to serve as an obstruction’ (§4.3.2). "

Prob. related to → liè1 列. "
2179-Hotspicy,"Hot, spicy",,,2179-Hotspicy,"  ‘Hot, spicy’, a late word which seems to have a Tai counterpart: Saek thaat < d- ‘peppers, spicy, hot’, Poai šaatᴰ²ᴸ < ǰ-, ‘hot, peppery’, Dioi (Yay) śat¹ (< *b-lat¹) [Maspero 1912: 87].  "

Boltz (JAOS 99, 1979: 429) relates là to a much later word written with the same phonetic ‘to cut off, terminate’ (i.e. a year) [GY].  ||  There is a ST alternative. The wf → yè4 葉 *lap encompasses the meanings ‘leaf > foliage > year > generation’. The present root *râp ‘new year / change of year’ seems to be a parallel etymon which also has a WT cognate rabs ‘generation’, Mikir rap, Rawang rəp ‘family’ [Bodman 1980: 86]."
2181-Waxcandle,"Wax, candle",,,2181-Waxcandle,"  ‘Wax, candle’ [GY].   ||  [E] ST: Maru rap ‘lac insect’, Nung k’ə-rap ‘wax’, WB kʰrip ‘lac’. Viet. sáp ‘wax’ belongs to those few words which have SV s- (< kr-) for MC l- [Maspero 1912: 80]. "

The range of meanings in TB (come > arrive > succeed > overcome > strength, power [Matisoff D. of Lahu: 1113]) connect lái etymologically with → lì1 力 ‘strength’.

2193-Balefulwindwindfromthemountains,"Baleful wind, wind from the mountains",,,2193-Balefulwindwindfromthemountains,"  ‘Baleful wind, wind from the mountains’ was transcribing an Indic syllable in the word vairambha, veramba ‘hostile wind’ (Hé Yǎnán, ZGYW 1999.4: 317), or a Turkic word (Chén Xiùlán ZGYW 1999.4: 319); the 風 ‘wind’ element was selected for semantic reasons and is not necessarily the phonetic element. "
2194-Indigo,Indigo,,,2194-Indigo,"  ‘Indigo’ [Shi].   ||  [E] Area word whose source may have been SE Asia: PAN *taƔum ‘indigo’ (Benedict AT: 112; STC: 155 n. 420, 421); PTai *gramᴬ² ‘indigo’ (Li F. 1976: 45) would be a backloan from OC (Egerod CAAAL 6, 1976: 56). WT rams ‘indigo’ is a CH loan (Laufer TP 17, 1916: 503). This word occurs also in other TB languages, note Mru charam ‘indigo’ (Löffler 1966: 140). Alternatively, Xie Caide (YWYJ 1999.10: 124) suggests that WT ram(-pa) ‘quick grass’ may be cognate to CH. "
2195-Basket,Basket,,,2195-Basket,"  ‘Basket’ [GY], the Northern Mǐn initial s- as in Jiàn’ōu saŋᶜ¹ may be due to loss of a pre-initial (Mei / Norman 1971: 99).  "

2197-Orchid,Orchid,,,2197-Orchid,"  ‘Orchid’ [Shi 95.1], a variant of the above, if not a copying error for it (Baxter 1992: 363); the same or a similar graph (written with the phonetic 間 or 閒) also writes a variant of → lián4 蓮 ‘lotus seed’. "
2198-Bigwave,Big wave,,,2198-Bigwave,"  ‘Big wave’ [Meng].   ||  [E] Huáng Jīnguì, Shěn Xíróng (YYWZX 1987.8: 45) suggest that → làng 浪 is a colloquial variant. This word is phonetically too distant from Tai to be related to S. kʰliinᴮ² (WrSiam gliːn).  "

It is not clear if and how zhòu 酎 (ḍjəuᴮ), LH ḍuᴮ, *druɁ ‘new spirits’ [Liji] could be related. Viet. ruoi ‘wine’ is not connected with any of the CH items because of the final -i; one could speculate that it goes with lǐ 醴 (lieiᴮ) LH leiɁ ‘new unclarified wine’ [BI, Shi] (for the lack of medial w in CH, see §10.2.1).

2218-Beoldgrowold,"Be old, grow old",,,2218-Beoldgrowold,"  ‘Be old, grow old’ [BI, Shi], the Northern Mǐn initial s- as in Jiàn’ōu seᶜ² may be due to loss of a pre-initial which might have been a velar considering the XS contact with kǎo 考 ‘old age’ (Mei / Norman 1971: 99).

This is a loanword from a Central Asian language, note Mongol ayiraƔ < *aƔiraƔ ‘fermented milk’ (Pulleyblank 1962: 250-3). This area word appears with the meaning ‘milk’ in Greek (t`o gála, gen. gálaktos) and Latin (lac, lactis) (Karlgren Deutsche Literaturzeitung 1926). The fermented drink ‘arrack’ may be a different etymon, a loan from Arabic ‘araq ‘fermented juice’ (so Pulleyblank 1962: 250 contra Karlgren 1926). "

2233-Tears,Tears,,,2233-Tears,"  ‘Tears’ [Chuci].  ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR luj (去); MGZY lue (去) [luɛ]  ||  [E] Lèi is a late OC word. For phonological reasons it can hardly be related to → qì5 泣 *khrəp ‘weep’. The closest TB comparandum might be WB re < *ri ‘water’, JP mə³¹-riɁ⁵⁵ ‘dew’, if we assume a ST *rwi (with regular loss of medial w).   ||  Most likely, this is a t-suffix derivation (nouns for naturally occurring things §6.2.1) of → liú3 流 *l(i)u ‘to flow’, hence lit. ‘the things that are flowing’. TB cognates suggest a ST and PCH medial*-j-; WT rgyun ‘the flow, current, stream’. "

2241-raccoondog,raccoon dog,,,2241-raccoondog,"  Mand. ‘raccoon dog’, also the second syllable in Mand. húlí 狐狸 ‘fox’, the latter already in Zuǒzhuàn and Mèngzǐ. But in Shūjīng, 狐貍 refers to two different animals where the ‘cat’ radical in lí as well as the association with → pí5 貔 (bji 4) ‘leopard’ imply a ‘wild cat’ of approximately fox size.   ||  [D] Acc. to FY 8.2, lí is a dialect word for the region west of the Passes (Wèi valley and around Xī’ān), whereas other regions have the following forms (discussed by Sagart ICSTLL 1990: 7): lái 悠 (lậi) LH lə in Chén (modern Hénán) and Chǔ (modern Húběi) and between the Yangtze and Huái rivers; pī 愈 (pʰji 3) LH pʰiə in northern Yān (Héběi, Liáoníng) and in northern Korea; pī-lí 愈貍 (pʰji 3-lji) south of the Yangtze at Guō Pú’s time (d. 324 AD). Zhào Zhēnfēng and Huáng Fēng suggest a connection with Miao ple, pli ‘cat’ (YWYJ 1998.10: 76-79). FY and Guō Pú consider all these to be dialect words for → pí5 貔 which is, however, a different word. The Northern Mǐn initial s- in 貍 as in Jiàn’ōu sɛᴬ² may be due to loss of a preinitial labial (Mei / Norman 1971: 99).  ||  [E] Perh. ST: Mru pri ‘kind of leopard’ (Löffler 1966: 147). If WT ži-mi ‘cat’ (also žim-bu ~ žum-bu) should derive from a hypothetical *ryi-mi, it could be cognate to lí. WT bi-ši (< -ži ?) ‘cat’ may then even be the equivalent of the CH dialectal pʰ-initial forms. In this case, the original CH word could have been a compound pí5 -lí 貔貍 ‘(large) cat’ + ’small cat’. But all this is uncertain, also because of possible Indic influence on WT words, see → pí5 貔. "
2242-Tocontrolregulateadminister,"To control, regulate, administer",,,2242-Tocontrolregulateadminister,"  ‘To control, regulate, administer’ [BI, Shi] is a cognate of → lǐ5 理. Sagart (1999: 127) relates this word to → zhì11 治 ‘regulate’.   "

2248-Toleavedepartfrombedispersed,"To leave, depart from, be dispersed",,,2248-Toleavedepartfrombedispersed,"  ‘To leave, depart from, be dispersed’ [Shi], ‘divide, distribute’ [Li]. It has been suggested that pǐ 仳 (pʰiᴮ / biᴮ) LH pʰiɁ / biɁ which occurs in Shījīng in the combination pǐ-lí ‘be separated’ represents an old pre-initial, note WT ’bral-ba ‘be separated’ (under → bān1 班) (so Dǒng Wéiguāng et al. CAAAL 22, 1984: 112f). Old Sino-Viet. rɐi (Pān Wùyún 1987: 28).  ||  [E] ST *ral: Mru ria < ral ‘separated from’ (Löffler 1966: 146; 134), JP ran³³ ‘be apart, separated, divided’ ᛝ mə³¹-ran³¹ ‘to place apart’ ᛝ pə³¹-ran³¹ ‘be separate, sort out’ ᛝ gə³¹-ran⁵⁵ ‘to divide, distribute’ ᛝ ra³¹ ‘be parted, separated’ (Wolfenden 1937: 646). Another derivation from the ST stem *(C-)ral is → bān1 班 with the common ST *-l > OC *-n shift.   ||  For an overview of similar items, see Table P-1 under → pī3 披. Some of the many similar ST roots could be related:   ||  1. *pai  ‘break’ → pò3  破    ||  2. *pai ‘separate, open’ → pī3  披  ||  3. *brai  ‘open’ → bǎi2  捭, → bò3 擘   ||  4. *trai  ‘open’ → zhā 奓, → zhé6 磔    ||  5. *pral ‘separate’ → bān1  班   ||  6. *ral  ‘separate, leave’    lí  離 (this entry)  ||  7. *hral  ‘split’ → chǐ1  拸    ||  8. *p(r)ək  ‘split’ → pì7  副    ||  9. *k-hlai  ‘separate’ → chǐ2, chí  誃   ||  Perhaps the stems in *-ai (1-4) form one large wf, as do perh. the forms in *-ral (5-7).

ST: WT brgyal (< b-r(-)yal) ‘to sink down (senseless), faint’; the basic ST meaning may be ‘to droop or fall by its / one’s own weight’. Pulleyblank (1962: 215) relates the WT word to → pí7 罷疲, but the WT b- is prob. a pre-initial. "
2251-Fencehedge,"Fence, hedge",,,2251-Fencehedge,"  ‘Fence, hedge’ [Chuci].  ||  [E] ST: TB: Tiddim gɔɔlF < rɔɔls ‘fence’.  "
2252-Hedge,Hedge,,,2252-Hedge,  ‘Hedge’ [Zhouli] is prob. related.
2254-Plum,Plum,,,2254-Plum,"  ‘Plum’ (Prunus salicina) [Shi], a fruit tree which originated in North China; the Northern Mǐn initial s- as in Jiàn’ōu sɛᶜ² may be due to loss of a pre-initial, PMin *˘ləiᴮ (Mei / Norman 1971: 101)."
2255-tiger,tiger,,,2255-tiger,"  Acc. to FY 8.1, this is a Chǔ dialect word for ‘tiger’ [FY, Yijing]. Zhào Zhēnfēng and Huáng Fēng (YWYJ 1998.10: 76-79) suggest a connection with the Tǔjiā words li-pa ‘male tiger’ and li-ni ‘female tiger’. The last syllable -ni could be related to MK-Khmer ɲiː ‘female’, unless it is a regional word for ‘mother’, then prob. the same etymon as → nǎi4 嬭.  "
2256-Village,Village,,,2256-Village,"  ‘Village’ [Shi]  ||  [E] Prob. ST *rwə: PTB *rwa > WB rwa ‘town, village’; WT ra-ba ‘fence, enclosure, wall, pen’. For the loss of ST medial *w in OC and WT, see §10.2.1. Note the Germanic semantic parallel Engl. town ᛝ German Zaun ‘fence’. The synonym PTB *gwa ‘village’ may belong to CH → qiū2 丘. <> Tai: S. ruaᶜ² < *r- ‘fence’ (Li F. 1976: 43) may also belong to this etymon.   ||  Alternatively, this word may belong to → lǐ4 理里 ‘divide into equal sections’, but pre- and early historic Chinese villages prob. were not systematically planned and platted.

2257-Cutjadeaccordingtoitsveins,Cut jade according to its veins,,,2257-Cutjadeaccordingtoitsveins,"  ‘Cut jade according to its veins’ [Guoce], ‘to divide fields into sections, boundaries’ 理  ||  [Shi]; ‘a mile’ 里 [Shi]. The basic meaning is ‘cut in a regular way, divide into equal sections’.  ||  [E] ST: This etymon is often considered to be related to PTB *riy ‘draw, paint, write, delimit’ etc. (STC no. 429; HST: 66) > Lushai riR ‘boundary, frontier, limit, line of demarcation’, NNaga *rəy ‘thread, boundary’, and WT ’bri-ba, bris ‘to draw, write’ ᛝ ris ‘figure’, WB reᴮ ‘write, delineate, paint’, Mru pri ‘to scratch’ [Löffler 1966: 133].

2259-Toregulatereason,"To regulate, reason",,,2259-Toregulatereason,"  ‘To regulate, reason’ [Yi]; ‘administer’ [Lüshi] is prob. related to → lí10 釐 ‘regulate’, and possibly also to → lǐ6 理 ‘envoy’. This item and → lǐ4 理 are usually thought to be the same word, which is possible: ‘divide into sections > regulate’. Middle Viet. mlẽ, mnhẽ ‘reason’ [Maspero 1912: 78] could perh. be a CH loan.

Initial p- is the Khmer causative prefix, which OC has replaced with the ST / POC causative prefix *s-.   ||  Alternatively, Unger (Hao-ku 36, 1990: 56) and CVST 2: 77 derive shǐ 史使 from → lǐ4 理里 (ljiᴮ) ‘to mark, draw lines’, hence lit. ‘scribe’. However, though perh. cognate to WT ’bri-ba ‘to write’, lǐ never seems to mean ‘to write, record’ in OC. Matisoff (D. of Lahu: 498) relates shǐ 史使 to PLB *Ɂ-dziy¹ > WB ce ‘send on business, employ’.   ||  This wf may belong to a larger group which includes → shì2 士仕 (dẓiᴮ).

Bauer [CAAAL 28, 1987: 61f] who, however, believes that the Tai word is a CH loan). Some Mǐn dialects have a different word: PMin *nɔi. "
2366-Rations,Rations,,,2366-Rations,"  ‘Rations’ 稟 [Li] (also read QY pjəmᴮ); ‘granary’ 廩 [BI, Shi]. "

"
2368-Shake,Shake,,,2368-Shake,"  ‘Shake’ 廩 [Zuo] > ‘full of fear, respectful’ 懍 [Xun].   ||  [D] This was a Han period Qín-Jìn (north western China) dialect word for ‘be careful, attentive 敬’ [FY 6,28].   ||  [E] Perh. related to → jìn3 禁 ‘forbid’ (so Shī Xiàngdōng 2000: 117). But in light of a possible OC labial initial (b-rəmɁ ?), a connection with MK-Khmer /praam/ ‘to prohibit, forbid’ would be phonologically closer. "
2369-Regret,Regret,,,2369-Regret,"  ‘Regret’ [Yi], ‘niggardly’ [Lun].   ||  [E] Geilich (1994: 249) compares this word with WT sri-ba ‘be parsimonious, niggardly’, Lepcha re ‘be rare’, Lushai renᴴ ‘to economize, be sparing with’. "
2370-Mountainrange,Mountain range,,,2370-Mountainrange,"  ‘Mountain range’ [GY] may simply be a late graphic variant of → líng6 陵, or be cognate to TB-Kachin kriŋ- < gliŋ- ‘hill’ (STC p. 34 n. 109). "
2373-Smallbellbannerbell,"Small bell, banner bell",,,2373-Smallbellbannerbell,"  ‘Small bell, banner bell’ [BI, Shi] is a sound-symbolic word, it may be related to → míng7 鳴 OCB *mrjeŋ ‘to sound’ acc. to Baxter (1992: 499). Theoretically, MC could also derive from a PCH *rin, then it may be related to WT ’dril-bu ‘bell’ (Shī Xiàngdōng 2000), but this is stretching the phonology. "
2375-Hill,Hill,,,2375-Hill,"  ‘Hill’ [Shi], ‘height’ [Zuo] may be the s. w. as → líng7 陵泠凌 ‘step on / over’.   ||  [E] Alternatively, líng could be ST: PTB *m-raŋ (STC p. 43): WB mraŋᶜ ‘high’, Trung mraŋ ‘high, long’, Kanauri raŋ ‘mountain, high’, NNaga *rəŋ ‘sky, Garo raŋ-ra ‘id.’, JP laŋ³¹ ‘mountain’. Also in AA-Khasi raŋ and roŋ in expressions for ‘high, above’. "

This etymon is prob. cognate to the near homo- nym → píng7 馮憑 ‘walk across’, just as there are doublets líng 凌 ~ → bīng2 冰 ‘ice’. Furthermore, this stem may be connected with → chéng7 徵懲 ‘suppress’. "
2377-Tofall,To fall,,,2377-Tofall,"  ‘To fall’ (of rain) 霝 [OB], 零 [Shi], ‘drop the leaves’ 蘦 [Chuci]. The graph originally consisted of 雨 ‘rain’ with ‘drops’ (not ‘mouths’) underneath.   ||  [T] MTang lieŋ < liŋ, ONW lėŋ  ||  [E] Etymology not clear. Perh. from AA and related to the items under → píng4 萍 ‘rain master’. Or note TB-JP mă³¹-raŋ³³ ‘rain’, raŋ³¹-ga³¹ ‘violent rain’ (CVST 2: 53). There is a remote possibility of a connection with → yǔn2 隕殞霣 ‘drop, fall, rain’ if one assumes a ST root *rwe- whose initial cluster is simplified to OC *re- and *we- respectively (§10.1.3). WB lañᴮ < *liŋᴮ ‘to fall’ belongs to → diān2 顛傎 ‘fall over’. "
2378-Divinefelicitousauspiciousexcellentintelligent,"Divine > felicitous, auspicious > excellent, intelligent",,,2378-Divinefelicitousauspiciousexcellentintelligent,"  ‘Divine > felicitous, auspicious > excellent, intelligent’ [BI, Shi]; ‘spirit (of Heaven)’ [Hanshu] > ‘ghost (of a deceased)’ [Hou Hanshu]  > ‘female shaman, shaman’ [Chuci].

Benedict connects the TB word with *(g-)liŋ ‘tube’ (French 1983: 525). The synonym → jǐng2 頸 is prob. not related. "
2380-Toordercommand,"To order, command",,,2380-Toordercommand,"  ‘To order, command’ [Shi].   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR liŋ (平去); MGZY ling (平去) [liŋ]; ONW lieŋ  ||  [N] In the OB and BI, 令 writes actually → mìng 命 ‘order’ to which it is usually thought to be related (so Wáng Lì 1982: 329). Acc. to (Downer 1959: 286), ‘to command’ [Zuo] is read in tone C, ‘to cause’ [Zuo] in tone A. "
2381-Tostayremaintarry,"To stay, remain, tarry",,,2381-Tostayremaintarry,"  ‘To stay, remain, tarry’ [Shi].   ||  [D] M-Xiàmén, Fúzhōu lauᴬ². The Northern Mǐn initial s- as in Jiànyáng seuᴬ² may be due to loss of a pre-initial: PMin *˘ləu (Mei / Norman 1971: 100). "
2382-Toslaughterkill,"To slaughter, kill",,,2382-Toslaughterkill,"  ‘To slaughter, kill’ [OB, Shi]; a Han period dialect word for ‘to kill’ in Qín, Jìn, Sòng and Wèi [FY 1, 16].   ||  [N] In the OB, this word was written with the graph for the cyclical sign mǎo 卯 (mauᴮ) < *mruɁ which seems to have been intended for writing ‘slaughter’ as it shows perh. two pieces of meat which have been cut apart.   ||  [T]  Sin Sukchu SR liw (平); MGZY liw (平) [liw]; MTang leu < liu, ONW lu < lu  ||  [D] The Northern Mǐn initial s- as in Jiànyáng seuᴬ² may be due to loss of a pre-initial (Mei / Norman 1971: 101).   ||  [E] Perh.

2383-Punishbydeathexecute,"Punish by death, execute",,,2383-Punishbydeathexecute,"  ‘Punish by death, execute’ [Shu]. Perh. this word is not related to liú; it could be the same word as → lù17 僇 ‘disgrace’. "
2384-Toflowfloatflowawaytheflow,"To flow, float, flow away; the flow",,,2384-Toflowfloatflowawaytheflow,"  ‘To flow, float, flow away; the flow’ [Shi]; ‘pendants of a banner’ 旒 [Shi].   ||  [T] Sin S.

2387-Gushforth,Gush forth,,,2387-Gushforth,"  ‘Gush forth’ [Guan], ‘a current, a stream’ is shared with Tai: S. riauᴮ² ‘rapids, vigorous, strong (current)’ (Manomaivibool 1975: 139). "
2388-Whistlingofthewind,Whistling of the wind,,,2388-Whistlingofthewind,"  ‘Whistling of the wind’ 翏 [Zhuang], 飀 [GY]; ‘wind high up in the air’ 飂 [L¨u]. "
2389-Ringingsoundintheear,Ringing sound in the ear,,,2389-Ringingsoundintheear,  ‘Ringing sound in the ear’ [Chuci]. 
2390-Eminent,Eminent,,,2390-Eminent,"  ‘Eminent’ [Zuo], ‘high’ [Guoce].  ||  [E] AA: Khmer ruŋ ‘be big, tall, mighty, pre-eminent’ ᛝ sruŋ ‘be long enough to cover’ [Jenner / Pou 1982: xli] ᛝ /sroŋ/ ‘big, full’.    ||  [E] MK *jruuŋ, *jruŋ ‘high, long’ (Shorto 2006 #690): Khmer /croŋ/ ‘to raise up, re-establish...’ ᛝ crūṅa /cròoŋ/ ‘be upright’; Riang tsərɔŋ, Khasi jrōŋ ‘high’. AA -> TB-Lepcha kroŋ ‘high’ (Forrest JAOS 82, 1962: 334).  ||  An AA substrate wf would explain the odd initial interchange *r- ~ *dzr- which is unusual in a Chinese wf. A syn. or parallel stem with initial OC *l is → sōng2 崧嵩 ‘high’ (mountain). The meaning chóng ‘high’ (of a mountain) may be due to paronomastic attraction from sōng, or from MK: Khmer cuṅa /coŋ/, OKhmer cuṅ /cuŋ/ ‘farthest point, end, tip, top, peak...’; perh. TB-Lushai čuŋR (Lorrain chung) ‘roof, top, summit, high up’ is related (Khmer loan?) "
2391-Topileonpilehigh,"To pile on, pile high",,,2391-Topileonpilehigh,"  ‘To pile on, pile high’ [Shi]; ‘high’ (of a mountain) [SW].   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR dʐuŋ (平); MGZY cung (平) [dʐuŋ] "

2393-Dragon,Dragon,,,2393-Dragon,"  ‘Dragon’ [OB, Shi] (discussed by Carr LTBA 13.2, 1990: 101 etc.).   ||  [E] Etymology not clear. Lóng has been associated with TB comparanda: WT ’brug ‘thunder, dragon’ may belong here or may be related to → lóng2 隆 ‘thundering’; Lolo lo ‘dragon’.  ||  Most likely is a connection with SE Asian words: AA: Viet. rô`ng ‘dragon’, Muong hông ~ ròṅ, Khmer roŋ ~ rôŋ, and KT: Siam. maḥroŋ ~ măroŋ. (CH -> ?) Viet thu`ông (via s- from Cr-) (Maspero 1912: 84).   ||  [C] A cognate may be → hóng1 虹 ‘rainbow’ (so Carr), note for example Y-Cónghuà loŋ⁴⁴ (ᴬ²) ‘rainbow’. "
2395-Birdcage,Bird cage,,,2395-Birdcage,"  ‘Bird cage’ [Zhuang], ‘basket’ [Zhouli].   ||  [E] MK: OKhmer /kruŋ/ ‘to cover, shelter, protect, to pen (animals)’ ᛝ druṅa /truŋ/ ‘pen, cage, coop for birds and animals’ < /-ruŋ/ ‘to shield, screen, protect, cover’; PSBahn. *gənruːŋ ‘prison, pig pen’. MK provides an etymology and is the source of loans into area languages: TB > WB khruiŋᶜ ‘cage for birds’, Garo griŋ (STC no. 389). AA -> KT: PTai *kroŋᴮ¹ ‘cage’, PAN *kuruŋ ‘cage’ (Thurgood 1994: 355). Less likely: PTai *kʰl-: S. kʰɔɔŋᶜ¹ ‘kind of basket’. "
2396-Deaf,Deaf,,,2396-Deaf,"  ‘Deaf’ [Zuo], the Northern Mǐn initial s- as in Jiànyáng soŋᴬ²  may be due to loss of a pre-initial (Mei / Norman 1971: 101). Perh. connected with → sǒng3 聳 ‘deaf’. "
2397-Mound,Mound,,,2397-Mound,"  ‘Mound’ 壟 [Li], 隴 [Xun], a Han period dialect variant for → zhǒng1 冢塚 ‘mound’ in the Qín-Jìn area [FY 13, 154]. It may perh. also be related to → lóu1 婁, lǒu 塿. "
2398-Tofondleplaywith,"To fondle, play with",,,2398-Tofondleplaywith,"  ‘To fondle, play with’ [Shi].  ||  [E] <> ? Khmer /lúuəŋ/  ‘to caress, pet, stroke, soothe...’ The Khmer initial consonant does not agree with OC, though; perhaps Khmer is a Post-Han or recent CH loan.  "
2399-Alleylane,"Alley, lane",,,2399-Alleylane,"  ‘Alley, lane’ [Nán-Qí shū, History of the Southern Qi dyn.], in Shànghǎi for xiàng 巷 ‘lane, alley’, prob. a variant (Zhāng Xīngyà YWYJ 1996.4: 11).  "
2400-Mound,Mound,,,2400-Mound,"  ‘Mound’ is a Han period dialect word for ‘small mound’ east of the Passes (i.e. central China) [FY 13, 154]. Lóu is usually the 2nd syllable of a compound, see under → fù7 阜. A Han period dialect variant in the Qín-Jìn area is perh. yú 堬 (jiu) *lo [FY 13, 154]. Finally, it may be related to → lǒng 壟隴 ‘mound’. "
2401-Bend,Bend,,,2401-Bend,"  ‘Bend’ [Xun], ‘hunchbacked’ [Zuo]. Although this word may possibly be a ST etymon derived from → gōu1 句鉤枸區: WT rgu-re ‘bent over’ ᛝ rgur ~ sgur ‘crooked’, it would require an unusual case of ST prefix preemption (Unger Hao-ku 75: 2002 discusses additional possible cases). Alternatively, lóu could belong to → zhǒu1 肘 ‘elbow’, or even be the s. w. as → lóu1 婁 ‘mound’.  "
2404-Toleak,To leak,,,2404-Toleak,"  ‘To leak’ [Shi, Zuo]. Old Sino-Viet. rɔ (Pān Wùyún 1987: 28).  ||  [T]  Sin Sukchu SR ləw (去); MGZY lhiw (去) [ləw]; MTang ləu, ONW lou  ||  [E] Perh. connected with AA: Khmer sroḥ /sraoh/ ‘be drained’ ᛝ samroḥ /sɑmraoh/ ‘to drain (land, pond)’ < -raḥ /-róh/ ‘to flow out, drain’. Khmer -> Tai: S. ruaᴮ² < *r- ‘to leak’ [Li F. 1976: 43]; the Tai vocalism agrees with Khmer forms, but not with the CH vowel. "
2405-Tostraindrip,"To strain, drip",,,2405-Tostraindrip,"  ‘To strain, drip’ [Guoce], ‘draw off water’ (from a pond) 漉 [Li]; ‘to strain, pour off’  盝 [Zhuang]; ‘net’ 䍡 [Guoyu].   ||  [E] ? ST: Lepcha rók ‘to sift, sieve’, perh. also WT ’kʰru-ba ᛝ ’kʰrud-pa ‘to bathe’ ᛝ ’kʰrus ‘bath’ (Geilich 1994: 32 f). Associating lòu and lù with different language families implies that they are unrelated. However, Lepcha may again be one of many AA loans, and WT may not be related. ‘Net’ may perh. be a different word related to TB-Mru lok ‘net’ (Löffler 1966: 142), but the initial consonants do not agree.  "
2406-Dripping,Dripping,,,2406-Dripping,  ‘Dripping’ (water) [Guoce].   ||  [C] A derivation is prob. → gōu2 溝 ‘a drain’. 
2408-Beblack,Be black,,,2408-Beblack,"  ‘Be black’ 盧壚 [Shu], 玈 [Zuo] has been compared to WT rog-po ‘black’ (HST: 44), but the rimes do not agree.  "
2409-Ahuthovelshelter,"A hut, hovel, shelter",,,2409-Ahuthovelshelter,"  ‘A hut, hovel, shelter’ [Shi], in Shījīng with reference to a field hut and an archery shelter, later in Shījīng a hut on a tomb, a ‘resting place, inn’ along a highway [Zhouli]. This looks like a variant (*l > *r) of → shè2 舍 ‘resting place’."
2410-Madderplant,Madder plant,,,2410-Madderplant,"  ‘Madder plant’, in Shījīng rú-lú 茹蘆 (nźjwo-ljwo). Because of the compound pú4-lú 蒲蘆 (buo-ljwo) it has been suggested that the OC form had a pre-initial labial whose loss may account for the initial s- in Northern Mǐn forms (Mei / Norman 1971: 98). "
2411-Head,Head,,,2411-Head,"  ‘Head’, a late word [Xin Tangshu], can be compared to Tai: S. pʰaak < *pʰr/l- ‘forehead’; see also → dú8-lóu 髑髏. "
2414-Saltyrocksalt,"Salty, rock salt",,,2414-Saltyrocksalt,"  ‘Salty, rock salt’ [BI, Zuo]. Li F. (1976: 45) draws attention to a possible connection with → gǔ15 盬 ‘salt’.    ||  [E] ST: PTB *s-la ‘salt’ > Miri əlo, PKaren *hla. Acc. to Matisoff (1995: 52), Baxter suggests a connection with the place name Lǔ 魯 which was a salt-marsh region in ancient times. The meaning ‘rustic, coarse’ [Zhuang] is sometimes thought to be connected with ‘salt’, but HST: 55 separates the two and relates ‘coarse’ to WT rags-pa ‘coarse, thick, gross’. "
2416-Alargeshield,A large shield,,,2416-Alargeshield,"  ‘A large shield’ [Li] has been compared to WB hlwaᴮ ‘shield’ (oblong and convex) (Unger Hao-ku 36, 1990: 52). "

Unger points to the morphological parallelism with WT:  ||  鏤  OCM  *rô  <>  WT  ’bru < ɴ-bru  ||  鏤  OCM  *rôh < *rôs  <>  WT  brus  ||  This wf is considered to be related to → bāo3 剝 ‘peel’, but ‘carve’ and ‘peel’ are rather different activities.

It may be an AA word instead: MK-PVM *k-raːɁ ‘way, path’, PWa *kraɁ ‘road’, Pearic kʰraː ‘road, path’, and Yao kla³. Cognate may also be → lüè3 略. "
2424-Grandloud,"Grand, loud",,,2424-Grandloud,"  ‘Grand, loud’ 路 [Shi], ‘big carriage, state carriage’ 輅 [Shu]. The expression lù qǐn 路寢 *râkh tshəmɁ ‘grand / royal apartment’ [Shi, Chunqiu] has the variant bó qǐn 柏寢 (pɐk tsʰjəmᴮ) *prâk-tshəmɁ [Hanfei] (Unger Hao-ku 29, 1984: 266) which means that the reconstruction and identification of lù is far from certain.

2426-Dewtocondenseintodroplets,"Dew, to condense into droplets",,,2426-Dewtocondenseintodroplets,"  ‘Dew, to condense into droplets’ (clouds) [Shi].  ||  An OC pre-initial may explain the initial s- in some Northern Mǐn dialects, thus PMin *ḷoᶜ > Jiàn’ōu su⁴⁴ (Mei / Norman 1971: 98). In a few dialects it means ‘fog’: W-Sūzhōu mi²⁴/²²- ləu²¹/⁴⁴.   ||  [E] Derived from → luò7 落 ‘to fall, drop’, the AA-Khmer stem also has the semantic extension ‘cover from above, drip’.

Perh. also WT gras ‘class, order, rank, tribe’ (Bodman 1980: 132) which is plausible in light of WT rus ‘bone’ ~ ‘clan’. Unger (Hao-ku 39, 1992) connects the WT word with → liè1 列 (ljät) ‘series’. "

2449-bloodandfatroundintestines,blood and fat round intestines,,,2449-bloodandfatroundintestines,"  The commentaries on the relevant passages in Lǐjì are ambiguous. One says ‘blood and fat round intestines’, another simply ‘fat r. i.’ A parallel passage in Shi 210,5 has 血膋 ‘blood and fat r. i.’; therefore the commentary to Li may have omitted or lost the reference to ‘blood’, consequently it appears that l means ‘blood’ (Unger Hao-ku 39, 1992). If this is the case, l would be a loan from PTai *lietᴰ²§ (rather than PKS *pʰlaːt⁷, Kadai *platᴰ) ‘blood’. If, on the other hand, l should be a homonym of liáo ‘intestines’, either or both could be connected with Viet-Muong: Viet. ru˘ôt, Muong rɔc ‘intestines’ [Pulleyblank JCL 22.1, 1994: 82]. "

2454-Twins,Twins,,,2454-Twins,"  ‘Twins’ [Lü] is an ancient Zhào-Wèi (Shanxi) dialect word for ‘twin’ [FY 3.1], it may be a doublet of → shuāng1 雙 *sroŋ (Baxter 1992: 227), but the putative ST roots would differ which speak against this (ST *zuŋ vs. *run).   ||  [E] ST: JP mə³¹-run⁵⁵ ‘twin’. "
2455-Egg,Egg,,,2455-Egg,"  ‘Egg’ [Zuo], the Northern Mǐn initial s- may be due to loss of a pre-initial which might have been a velar considering Duàn Yùcái’s comment that luǎn is read like guān 關 (Mei / Norman 1971: 99).   ||  [E] ST: PTB *(s-)rwa ‘nit’ > WT sro-ma ‘eggs of louse, nit’, JP tsiɁ-ru ‘louse eggs’ (Benedict 1976: 190).

OC has *r instead of the expected *l (TB) in the initial probably due to pronomastic attraction to AA: Khmer gra’ka /kruk/ (vowel /u/ instead of /a/ because of the voiced initial) ‘be low, debased’ < -ra’ka /-ruk/ ‘to fall, be low, cover from above’.  ||  Allofams with OC *r-: → xià1 下 ‘descend’, → lù8 露 ‘dew’; allofam with ST L-like initial: → tuò4 蘀 *lhâk ‘fallen leaves’.

2494-Vein,Vein,,,2494-Vein,"  ‘Vein’ [Zuo].  ||  [E] ST: Lushai marᴴ < mar ‘the pulse’. As often, CH has added a final -k (§6.1): The OC form is derived from *mer-k or perh. rather *mər-k, since OC *ə would agree with PTB *a (MC -ɛk can derive from both OC *-rək and *-rek); mài does not occur in early rimes which would decide the issue. "

2497-Wheat,Wheat,,,2497-Wheat,"  ‘Wheat’ [Shi] is often considered to be related to lái 來 below (so Wáng Lì 1982: 92; Baxter 1992: 328).   ||  [D] PMin *mak > Amoy beɁᴰ², Fúzhōu maɁᴰ²  ||  [E] Acc. to Pulleyblank (EC 25, 2000: 23), 來 is the original graph for mài, while 麥 (with the element ‘foot’) was originally intended for the much more common lái ‘come’, hence lái ‘wheat’ is spurious. However, TB cognates PLB *g-ra² ‘buckwheat’ [Matisoff D. Lahu: 1116], WT gro ‘wheat’ are phonologically closer to lái. "

In Lshì chūnqiū the word rimes apparently with dǎo 倒 *dauɁ/h (no final *-k, vowels differ), GY has an alternate reading for 媢 in tone B (< *-Ɂ), hence no OC final -k.    ||  [E] ST: WB muiᴮ ‘cover without contact, spread overhead, be chief’ ᛝ ə-muiᴮ ‘roof, a chief’ (WB also hmû ‘be chief’ ᛝ ə-hmû ‘chief’).

2592-Dense,Dense,,,2592-Dense,"  ‘Dense’ (of clouds, dwellings) [BI, Shi] is acc. to Baxter (1992: 436) possibly cognate to the following (unless it is the s. w. as → mì4 密 ‘near’): "

2598-Cover,Cover,,,2598-Cover,"  ‘Cover’ [Shi] reflects dialect confusion *-ek ~ *et (Baxter 1992: 300; 484).   ||  Acc. to Baxter (1992: 300), this is perh. cognate to bì 辟 (biek) [bek] *bêk, OCB *ɴ-pek ‘inner coffin’ [Zuo]. Karlgren (1956: 18) considers mì an allofam of → míng2 冥 ‘dark’.  "

2600-Sleep,Sleep,,,2600-Sleep,"  ‘Sleep’ 瞑 [Zhuang]. The graph 眠 is encountered only late in Han period texts [Shanhaijing] and since for 瞑; it thus does not reflect the OC phonetic parameters of the phonetic series GSR 457 民 (*min ~ *mən). Mián is distinct from → míng4 瞑 ‘close eyes’.   ||  [T] MTang mian < mian, ONW mėn  ||  [E] ST: PTB *myel [STC no. 197] > Chepang mel- ‘close, shut eyes’, Bahing mjel ‘sleepy’, WB myañᴮ ‘be sleepy, sleep’; JP mjen³¹-mjen³¹ ‘to sleep soundly’ ᛝ mjet³¹ ‘sleep a while’  (HST: 134). "
2601-Cotton,Cotton,,,2601-Cotton,"  ‘Cotton’ 棉 [Bái Jū-yì, Tang period]; ‘wool’ in mián yáng 綿羊 ‘sheep’ (lit. ‘wool goat’) [Sungshi]. This is a late word, unless mián-mán 綿蠻 ‘tiny, delicate’ in Shījīng is derived from ‘wool’.   ||  [E] ? ST: WT bal ‘wool’; for the initials, see §5.12.2.

2605-Togivebirth,To give birth,,,2605-Togivebirth,"  ‘To give birth’ [OB (acc. to Guo Moruo), Guóyǔ: Yuèyǔ; Wénxuǎn, GY], GY adds some other readings; a Qí 齊 (Shandong) dialect word acc. to a commentary to Wénxuǎn (Wáng Lì 1982: 585).   ||  [E] This word appears to form a ST-like *mra/enɁ ~ *sre/anɁ pair with → chǎn3 產 *sre/anɁ ‘produce’ (§2.4.3), hence miǎn seems to be a ST etymon. Nevertheless, miǎn and chǎn could equally well belong to MK: Khmer samrāla /sɑmraal/ (s-m-raal) ‘to give birth to, deliver’ < rāla /ríiəl/ ‘to increase, ... distribute, propagate’. Perhaps AA has been the source of OC *mranɁ which then coincided with the ST s- ~ m- pattern. "
2606-Ceremonialcap,Ceremonial cap,,,2606-Ceremonialcap,"  ‘Ceremonial cap’ [BI, Shu] could be related either to → biàn1 弁 [biɑnᶜ] ‘a cap’ (so Wáng Lì 1982: 582), or to → mì7 冪冥 ‘cover’; both proposals present phonological problems.  "

The phonetic is → zhāo4 朝 ‘morning’ whose Siamese relative has a labial cluster *br-. Thus Tai ‘morning’ and MY ‘house’ happen to be near homophones. As to foreign initial b- for CH m-, see §5.12.2.

Perh. reanalysis as derivation from → huī6 墮隳 *hmai ‘destroy’ is responsible (*hmai + t > hmet). The direct phonological counterpart of PTB *mit may be → mò4 沒 *mut ‘disappear, die; perish in water or fire’, but see there (for *mit ~ *mut variation, see §11.5.1). "

The meaning ‘to sully, soil, besmirch’ (reputation of an ancestral house) 衊 [Hanshu] > ‘sore eye, troubled eyesight’ 臭 [Lüshi], ‘blood shot’ (eye) [Shiming] could be a semantic extension of either → miè2 蔑 ‘not have’. The Hànshū phrase wū miè 污衊 has prob. led to the SW (2145b) gloss wū xuě 污血 ‘sully with blood’ which implies a meaning ‘blood’ for miè and which has been copied into later dictionaries as ‘blood’. Nevertheless, the notion ‘blood’ seems closely associated with this word; note also the expression xuě-miè 血衊 ‘to stain with blood’; Sagart (1999: 153) relates miè to TB-Tujia mie⁵³ ‘blood’ [Huáng Bùfán, TB Lexicon no. 129].

2625-Stringfishingline,"String, (fishing) line",,,2625-Stringfishingline,"  ‘String, (fishing) line’ [Shi].   ||  [E] The MC rime can also derive from *-in, *-un or *-iŋ in which case this word may be a variant of → shéng0 繩 OCM *m-liəŋ (so Mei Tsu-Lin 1985). On the basis of a Shījīng rime Baxter (1992: 281) suggests that mín is derived from the same root as the synonym → lún3 綸 OCB *g-rjun. "
2626-Suffering,Suffering,,,2626-Suffering,"  ‘Suffering’ [Shi].  ||  [E] This wf is homophonous with → mǐn1 閔 ‘exert oneself’; they may be the same etyma (‘be pained’ ~ ‘take pains’). The relationship with → mèi7, huì 痗 ‘pained’ is not clear.  "
2627-Bedistressed,Be distressed,,,2627-Bedistressed,"  ‘Be distressed’ [Shi] > ‘grieved, commiserating’ 愍 [Zuo], 憫 [Meng], ‘sorry, melancholy’ 暋 [Zhuang], a late tone B variant of mín 痻 (Baxter 1992: 433-434). "

2631-Exertoneself,Exert oneself,,,2631-Exertoneself,  ‘Exert oneself’  [Shi].  ||  [E] This wf and the homophonous → mín4 痻 may be the same etymon (‘be pained’ ~ ‘take pains’). Allofams may be → wěi6 亹眉 ‘be vigorous’ (so Wáng Lì 1982: 410); Wáng also adds → miǎn1 勉 ‘make an effort’; see there also for mǐn-miǎn 黽勉.

2635-Todestroyruin,"To destroy, ruin",,,2635-Todestroyruin,"  ‘To destroy, ruin’ [Zuo].   ||  [E] ? AA: Khmer riana [ríiən] ‘to exert oneself, endeavor...’. <> Tai: S. manᴮ¹ < *hm- ‘diligent’ (Manomaivibool 1975: 239) is perh. a CH loan.  "
2636-snake,snake,,,2636-snake,"  Name of today’s Fújiàn area, its major river, and the non-Han people who used to live there [Zhouli]. Mǐn does not mean ‘snake’ (Zev Handel, p.c.), the ‘snake’ radical [SW] is sometimes used in the names of barbarians. Acc. to JDSW (and following it, JY), the graph has other readings: wén, and mán; the composition of the graph 閩 indicates that the Zhōulǐ and Han time reading was not mán. "
2639-Vesseldishbowel,"Vessel, dish, bowel",,,2639-Vesseldishbowel,"  ‘Vessel, dish, bowel’ [Zuo], the word is much older than Zuǒzhuàn because its graph prob. goes back to the beginning of writing. Bodman (1980: 121) compares this to Viet. mâm, PVM *Ɂbəmᴬ ‘food tray’ [Thompson]. Initial and final m are incompatible in CH, hence final -ŋ. "

The word was read in tone A in Shījīng (Mattos 1971: 309). In the OB and BI (except late WZhou BI) only the graph 令 ‘order’ occurs, while the received texts write 命, i.e. 令 with kǒu 口 ‘mouth’ added to indicate that 令 is a phonetic or semantic loan. Because mìng is the ordinary word for ‘to order’, and because the break between 令 (early inscriptions) and 命 (later texts) is quite abrupt, 令 must have stood for 命 in all Shang and Western Zou inscriptions.  ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR miŋ (去); MGZY ming (去) [miŋ]; ONW meŋ  ||  [D] PMin *miaŋᶜ ‘life’ > Amoy miãᶜ², Fúzhōu miaŋᶜ²  ||  [<] Possibly an r-causative / trans. derivation from the noun míng 名 *min ~ *meŋ ‘name’ (§7.5); later an exoactive *-s / -h was added (§4.3.2).  ||  [E] If related (so Wáng Lì 1982: 329), → lìng 令 ‘order’ may have preserved a ST or PCH pre-initial *r-, hence *mreŋ < *r-miŋ which makes it a homophone of PTB *r-miŋ ‘name’ (so STC: 155 n. 419; Granet 1948: 292). WB minᶜ ‘command’ (a CH loan?) is prob. also related. "
2642-Inscription,Inscription,,,2642-Inscription,"  ‘Inscription’ [BI, Liji].   ||  [E] Míng 銘 is commonly thought to be related to → míng1 名, but the semantic link is not compelling. Phonologically, this word agrees with WT byaŋ-ma / -bu ‘inscription, direction, label, tablet’ (on which an inscription is written); for OC *m- = WT b-, see §5.12.2; for OC *-e- = WT -ya-, see §11.3.2. If related, the WT item must be a very old CH loan because there was no writing on the ST level. "

2644-Ocean,Ocean,,,2644-Ocean,"  ‘Ocean’ [Zhuang, Lie], as in běi míng 北冥 ‘northern ocean’, nán míng 南冥 ‘southern ocean’.   ||  [E] Commentators explain that míng ‘ocean’ is the s. w. as → míng2 冥 ‘dark, black’ (of water) (likely in light of parallelism with the unrelated → hǎi1 海). There is an outside chance, though, that the etymon is instead connected with PTB *mlik >  OBurm. mlac ‘river’, WB -mrac, Arakanese mreik ‘sea’, SChin-Daai mlik (tui) ‘big water, river, sea’ (tui ‘water’). "
2645-Closetheeyes,Close the eyes,,,2645-Closetheeyes,"  ‘Close the eyes’ [Zuo]. Karlgren relates míng to → míng2 冥 ‘dark’.  ||  [E] GY makes a phonetic distinction between → mián1 瞑 ‘sleep’ (< ST *mel) and míng 瞑 ‘close eyes’ and treats these as two separate words. This is not an example of an occasional *-ŋ ~ *-n variation because ST *-l is not known to show up as CH -ŋ. Also, WB distinguishes hminᴮ ‘have the eyes shut’ and myañᴮ ‘to sleep’ < *mel. Here and in the next two items the etyma míng ‘dark’, míng ‘close eyes’ and mián ‘sleep’ have bled into each other so that they are difficult to separate out:"

2660-Thetip,The tip,,,2660-Thetip,"  ‘The tip’ [Liji], ‘end of’ (branch, extremities, legs) [Zuo], ‘end, final, last’ [Shu] > ‘to diminish’ [Zuo].  ||  [E] The etymology is not certain. Most likely, mò is derived from → wú4 無 [muɑ] *ma ‘not have, there is no’, thus meaning something like ‘the thing which comes to nothing’, with the nominalizing suffix -t (§6.2.1). Perh. AA: PMonic *mɔh, Mon moh, mah ‘tip, end, edge’ had some paronomastic influence on the creation of the CH word, if mò is not an outright substrate word.

Note the semantic connection between interrogative and indefinite pronouns in many lgs., incl. Mandarin, e.g. 沒甚麼 ‘it is nothing’. "
2686-Troubledeyesight,Troubled eyesight,,,2686-Troubledeyesight,"  ‘Troubled eyesight’ [Zhuang].   ||  [E] ST: WT rmogs-pa ‘eyes heavy with sleep, inert, languish’. Mòu may be cognate to → wù12 霧 (so HST: 82), but TB keeps the two roots distinct. "
2687-Male,Male,,,2687-Male,"  ‘Male’ (of quadrupeds) [OB, Shi], opposite → pìn0, bì 牝 ‘female’.    ||  [E] AA: OKhm jmol [cmọọl] ‘male of animals’, Aslian lgs.

For the absence of a coda in CH after a foreign long vowel, see §6.9. The OB graph for this word shows a vertical stick on a horizontal ground (inverted T). The explanation may be that it was intended for an obsolete homophone, a cognate of PVM *c-mɔːlɁ ‘digging stick’. ‘Male’ and ‘digging stick’ are derivatives from a stem represented in OKhmer cval /cuuəl/ ‘to enter, penetrate, (of animals) copulate’, Khmu cmɔɔl ‘planter du riz au plantoir’ ᛝ crmɔɔl ‘plantoir’ [Ferlus MKS 7, 1978: 20-22]; from ‘digging stick’ to ‘ploughing’ to ‘acre’ are simple steps, hence mǔ ‘male’ and → mǔ5 畝 ‘field’, though not homophones in OC, may well go back to the same AA etymon.

(1) Mǔ is either derived from a hypothetical ST *məɁ: PTB *ma ‘mother’ > WT Ɂa-ma, Chepang ma (*məɁ) (so HST: 110). Or (2) OC *moɁ is cognate to PTB *mow ‘woman, bride’ (STC no. 297) > WT  -mo ‘female suffix’, Chepang mo ‘wife’, Lushai mooᴴ ‘bride, daughter-in-law’ (so Bodman 1980: 136; Baxter 1992: 469). In languages of the area words for ‘mother, woman, female, daughter’ have initial *m- followed by almost any vowel: OC *môɁ ‘mother’, WT mo, ma ‘female’, ma generally ‘mother’, LB ma ‘female, girl, woman’, WB maᶜ ‘sister’, OC *məs ? ‘younger sister’, LB mi² ‘female’ ᛝ miᶜ ‘mother, madam, daughter’; AA-MMon mi, OKhmer me ‘mother’.

2689-Femaleteacherinharem,Female teacher in harem,,,2689-Femaleteacherinharem,"  ‘Female teacher in harem’ [Zuo] is cognate to → huì6  誨 ‘to instruct’; we should expect OCM *mə̂Ɂ, but the word has coalesced with → mǔ2 母 ‘mother’ due to paronomastic attraction.  "
2690-Thumb,Thumb,,,2690-Thumb,"  ‘Thumb’ [Guoyu], ‘big toe’ [Yi].   ||  [E] ST: PL: *C-ma³ ‘thumb’ (in composites for ‘thumb’ and ‘big toe’). The vowels do not agree, we should expect OC *məɁ for PTB *ma; *moɁ may be due to association with → mǔ2 母 *moɁ ‘mother’, just as the PL word may be related to ma ‘mother’. "
2691-Anacre,An acre,,,2691-Anacre,"  ‘An acre’ [BI, Shi].   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR mu, məw (上); MGZY muw (上) [muw]  ||  [D] In many dialects, including some Mandarin ones, ‘acre’ is not a homophone of mǔ 母 ‘mother’: W-Sūzhōu col. mᶜ², Wēnzhōu mɛᴮ²; X-Chángshā mɣuᴮ; G-Nánchāng mɛuᴮ; Y-Guǎngzhōu mauᴮ²; M-Xiàmén bɔᴮ.

If OC *muk, the word would be directly related to the PTB form *mik by way of the ST *u ~ *i alternation (§11.5.1). If OC *miək, the word would be directly related to the PLB form *myak.    ||  [C] → móu3 眸 ‘pupil of the eye’ is sometimes thought to be related to mù (so Wáng Lì 1982: 312). "

2695-Late,Late,,,2695-Late,"  ‘Late’ (in a season, year’) 莫 [Shi], ‘evening’ 暮 [Meng].   ||  [E] Two possible etymologies: (1) the original meaning is ‘late’. (2) Or this word is related to ‘dark, cover’ → mò8 莫瞙暯 ‘obscure’. See under → hēi 黑 for possible wider relations. Since TB roots are inconclusive as to their ST source, Limbu makt- ‘to become night’ may either be a direct cognate of mù 莫暮 (not very likely given the frequent semantic connection ‘dark’ ~ ‘night’ – not ‘late’ ~ ‘night’), or ᛝ Limbu mak ‘black, dark’ (which may equally well be a cognate of → hēi 黑). Related may also be Lepcha ma ‘be secret, concealed, disappear’. "
2696-Tombgraveyard,"Tomb, graveyard",,,2696-Tombgraveyard,"  ‘Tomb, graveyard’ [BI, Shi].

KT forms are not as close to CH: Tai: S. niiᶜ² < *n- ‘this’, S. nanᶜ² < *n- ‘that’; Nung nayᶜ², Wuming naiᶜ² etc. ‘this’ (HCT: 113). Mand. nà corresponds to an OC *naih > nâᶜ. The OC pronominal n-suffix (§6.4.5) is probably derived from one of these forms. "

2713-Somekindofpear,Some kind of pear,,,2713-Somekindofpear,"  ‘Some kind of pear’ (3rd cent. AD). Japanese (kara)nashi 梨 could be the analogue to OC *nas and thus be related (Unger Hao-ku 22, 1983). See comment under → méi4 梅. "
2714-NA,NA,,,2714-NA,"  A late classical col. variant of → rú1 如 (or prob. rather MC nźjwoᶜ) in the classical expression rú hé 如何 = nài hé 奈何 (occurrence of nài in Shūjīng is spurious, a later gloss) (Unger Hao-ku 22, 1983).

Benedict (ICSTLL 1989: 7) relates this to PTB *nam (his *nəm) ‘sun, day, sky’ > PTib. *g-nam ‘sky’ ᛝ nam ‘night’, also ‘rain, god’ in other TB languages. This etymology finds support in the old CH tradition which associates the south with the sunny side → yáng9 陽, the north with → yīn5 陰 ‘the dark side’, → míng2 冥 ‘darkness, night’, shuò 朔 (ṣåk) ‘new moon, north’ (under → nì6 逆), hence nán could originally have been the counterpart to the dark north.

2721-Toblush,To blush,,,2721-Toblush,  ‘To blush’ [Meng] is perh. related to TB-Karen ńa ‘red’ (STC: 159). 
2722-Toreachfor,To reach for,,,2722-Toreachfor,  ‘To reach for’ [Tangyun] is perh. related to PVM *nəm ‘to take’.

This word is unique to Monic and may be a derivation by n-infix (Diffloth 1984: 67). The loss of foreign final -y/-i  in OC has parallels (§6.9). However, the Mon word could be a Pali loan instead: khanoi (Shorto).  ||  Alternatively, the word may be connected with KD: Be ma³-lu² ‘monkey’, PHlai nok [Matisoff 1988c: 311]; cf. PTB *mruk, PLB *myok (several Loloish dialects have n-) [Matisoff]. Syn. → yù9 禺 ‘monkey’.  "

Among others, the word nǎo 惱 ‘to anger, irritate’ is written with the same phonetic and is cognate to a wf in OC *-au (→ náo3 撓), but 惱 is late [SW] and cannot help identify the OC and LH vowel of 腦.   ||  [E] ST: PTB *nuk > PLB *nok ~ *Ɂnok  ~ *nuw ‘brains’ (Matisoff 1972: 62), WB uᴮ-hnok ‘brain’, JP nuɁ⁵⁵ < nuk ‘brain’.

2738-Behungrydesirous,"Be hungry, desirous",,,2738-Behungrydesirous,"  ‘Be hungry, desirous’ [Shi]. Wáng Lì (1982: 308) relates this word to nì 覘 (niek) *-iɔk ‘grieved’ [Han]. "
2740-Tenderdelicate,"Tender, delicate",,,2740-Tenderdelicate,"  ‘Tender, delicate’, a late word [GY, JY].   ||  [E] Etymology is not clear. Perh. a variant of → ruǎn 耎軟 (ńźjwänᴮ). Alternatively, it may be ST, related to WB nunᴮ ‘weak, exhausted from illness’, but this meaning barely overlaps with nèn ‘soft to touch’. <> PMY *-on, individual lgs. have forms like lun⁵, gun⁵, Ãtʃoŋ⁵ (Wáng Fúshì). Finally, nèn is reminiscent of AA items: PMonic *lɁun ‘be flexible, soft to touch’ (of body part etc.), and / or PVM *k-rn-ɔːn ‘young, tender’ > Viet. non (acc. to Ferlus, an infix derivation from *kɔːn ‘son’).

Xiàmén lanᴮ ‘we’ (inclusive) is laŋᴬ²  + a pronominal suffix -n which in turn is derived from nóng; Fúzhōu iᴬ¹-nøiŋ ‘they’. Acc. to Norman (1983: 208), the semantic development is ‘peasant’ (→ nóng1 農) > ‘person’ > pronoun ‘I, me’. Alternatively, since a syllable noŋ occurs in some Zhuang (Tai) dialects in forms for the first person pronoun, Pān Wùyún and Chén Zhōngmǐn (JCL 23.2, 1995) suggest that nóng is a substrate word from the earlier ‘Hundred Yuè’ 百越 where nóng was a clan name and ethnonym, then > ‘person’ > ‘I, me’.

Perh. this is not a cognate but a TB loan because there is no obvious OC word with the meaning ‘illness’ from which nuó could have been derived (→ nà4 譫 ‘sick’ is a medieval word, and the etymology of → shǔ2 癙 ‘painful’ is not certain); the OC rime *-ai creates difficulties for a genetic relationship as well.

However, resemblance to a SE Asian word for ‘sea, ocean’ is striking: TB-WB paŋ-lai ‘ocean’, JP paŋ³³-lai³³ id.

The meaning ‘soul’ has probably been transferred from the moon since men must have been aware of lunar phases long before they had developed theories on the soul. This is supported by the etymology ‘bright’, and by the inverted word order which can only have originated with meteorological expressions, see → pò5 霸魄. The association with the moon explains perh. why the pò soul is classified as Yin (see for example Matisoff 1978: 268) in spite of the etymology ‘bright’ (which should be Yang), hún’s Yang classification may be due to the association with clouds and by extension sky, even though the word invokes ‘dark’. ‘Soul’ and ‘moon’ are related in other cultures, by cognition or convergence, as in TB: PLB *s/Ɂ-la³ ‘moon, soul, spirit’ (HPTB: 39), WT bla ‘soul’ ᛝ zla ‘moon’, PMY *b˘laᴬ/ᶜ ‘spirit, soul, moon’ (Benedict ICSTLL 1989: 8).  ||  Pò is related to → bái1 白 ‘white’ (Carr CAAAL 24, 1985: 62).  ||  The connection, if any, with MK comparanda is not clear: Khmer braḥ ‘devil, spirit’, Stieng brah, Chrau m’brãh; AA -> TB-Lepcha blyak ‘devil, spirit’ (Forrest JAOS 82, 1962: 333).

In this phrase, the subject pò follows the verb as in meteorological phenomena (note xià yǔ 下雨 ‘rain falls’, see Gabelentz 1881,  p. 144).  ||  [E] This is the same word as → pò4 魄 and cognate to → bái1 白 ‘white’ (Ying-shi Yü JAS 41, 1981: 83; Shaughnessy; Matisoff ‘Stars, moon, spirit’, ICSTLL 1978); TB languages also associate ‘moon’ with ‘white’ [French 1983: 578f]."

In OC, this is only a reginal word restricted to the east and south of the Huai River, it is to this day found in place names in the same area, i.e. in the ancient Wú, Yuè and Chǔ lands. Guō Pú (d. 324 AD) confirms that pǔ ‘bay, cove, inlet’ is a Jiāngnán (i.e. a southern dialect) word (Norman 1983: 206).  ||  [E] MK: Viet phá < pʰaɁ ‘inlet, cove’ (Norman). This word is prob. indirectly related to PKS *pwaŋᴮ ‘bank, shore’, Tai: Saek viaŋᶜ¹ ‘bank of a river’ by way of the *-Ɂ ~ *-ŋ alternation (§3.2.4). Less likely, KT may belong to → fáng1 坊防 ‘dyke’.

3016-sheep,sheep,,,3016-sheep,"  Name of different western TB tribes from Shang OB down to the present. The graph implies that these people raised sheep. Pulleyblank (1983: 418f) suggests that the name is derived from → yáng 羊 ‘sheep’ which is also phonetic, although the SW states that the graph is a semantic compound. However, the name Qiāng may be a foreign word which brings to mind WT skyoŋ-ba, bskyaŋs ‘to guard, keep, tend’ (animals), PTB *kyoŋ (STC no. 161), Qiāng means then ‘herders’.

One ancient commentator remarks that anciently qīn sounded like qiān 千 *snhîn by which he may, or may not, have been pointing to an n-initial (§5.9.1.1); if the word had an n-initial, it could be related to → rén2 仁 (so Boodberg 1937: 362), especially considering the overlapping meanings ‘to love’.   ||  More likely, qīn is related to the stem → jí7 即 ‘approach > be close’ with the nominalizing n-final (§6.4.3), then lit. ‘persons close to oneself, close ones’; the meaning ‘oneself’ is more likely to derive from the notion ‘close’ than from ‘to love’. Furthermore, WT has a semantic parallel: gñen ‘a kinsman, relative’ < ñe-ba ‘be near, approach’. "
3061-China,China,,,3061-China,"  The western state of Qín and the dynasty. Qín is often thought to be the source of ancient European words for ‘China’: Lat. ‘Sina’ etc., modern Western languages ‘China’. Also the word for ‘silk’ may ultimately be derived from this name: Gr. sērikón, i.e. ‘the Chinese one, (the stuff) from China’. These ancient loans suggest that the original final was *-r, not *-n (Pulleyblank 1962: 229-230). The graph was originally intended for zhēn (tṣjɛn) ‘hazel’. "

It appears to be the same word as → qín5 擒 ‘catch’ (animals etc.) and would thus be parallel to shòu 狩 ‘to hunt’ ~ → shòu3 獸 ‘wild animal’. However, the similarity with the common AA word for ‘bird’ is striking:  ||  AA: PVM -ciːm ‘bird’ [Ferlus] (the initial of Viet. căm [kəmᴸ] ‘bird’ could be the result of interference from OC); PMon *kɲciəm ‘bird’ (general term), Kyanzittha OMon (12th cent.

It is also unlikely that a language family would borrow a marginal OC word (the CH word for ‘bird’ has been (mutatis mutandis) the equivalent of Mand. → niǎo 鳥 throughout the ages). Therefore early PMK *kcəm is the source for OC (there are more OC animal names of AA origin). The voiced velar initial may have won out in OC because of the semantic association of ‘game bird’ with qín ‘catch’, so that the two words converged. If qín ‘catch’ should go back to some early MK word, the two items might have been nearly identical: note OMon ckem ‘grasp’ (under → jiān7 兼) vs. a hypothetical *kcem ‘bird’. "
3067-Tocatchcapture,"To catch, capture",,,3067-Tocatchcapture,"  ‘To catch, capture’ (animals, people, booty) [BI, Guoyu].  ||  [E] Etymology not certain. TB-WT sgrim-pa ‘to hold fast, force / twist together, squeeze in’ (Gong in W. Wang 1995: 86) is semantically rather removed from qín; PTamang *kim ‘to take’ [S. Georg 1996: 309] should correspond to a MC palatal initial. The word may, however, derive from an AA variant of → jiān7 兼 *kêm ‘grasp’.

The CH aspiration may stem from a post-initial glottal stop (§5.9.4). "
3079-Feelings,Feelings,,,3079-Feelings,"  ‘Feelings’ [Shi, Zuo], ‘proper nature, circumstances’ [Meng], or more fundamentally ‘quality, attribute, feature’ (Boltz JAOS 120.2, 2000: 225ff). The meaning ‘feelings’ has led to attempts to connect the word with ST *s-niŋ ‘heart’ (Benedict 1976: 170 n. 8), but the meaning ‘proper nature’ suggests that this word is rather cognate to → shēng2 生 ‘live, life’ (Boltz), although the initials are difficult to reconcile.

3086-Tosuspend,To suspend,,,3086-Tosuspend,"  ‘To suspend’ [Li] > ‘musical stone’ [BI, Shi]. Since OCM medial *-w- is sometimes lost before high front vowels (§10.2.1), this word may be related to → xuán4 縣懸 ‘suspend’. <> Or perh. connectd with PMiao klaaŋ¹ [Purnell] ‘to hang, dangle’. "

3101-Toswim,To swim,,,3101-Toswim,"  ‘To swim’ [Lie].  ||  [E] Since this word is late, it may simply be a dialect variant of → yóu6 游遊, as in some dialects original *j- becomes a fricative (note Mǐn above). Bodman (1980: 179) draws attention to a Lushai word hlew ‘swim’. "

This may be a nominal derivation by k-prefix (§5.4) from → xū2 虛 ‘empty’ (Karlgren 1956: 18). Note Lushai koᴴ ‘a mound, bank, raised ground...’ which may be related.

Both were once in the non-Chinese sphere of the ancient state of Chǔ and its neighbors. The Chǔ ruling clan Xióng 熊 (‘bear’) had the name mǐ 羋 ‘bear’ which points to a KT presence (KT mui ‘bear’).

This word survives in col. coastal Mǐn: Xiàmén liᴮ, Fúzhōu nyᴮ (Norman 1988: 234), while most dialects have forms which go back to → ěr5 爾.

Shí could be equally close to the AA or the TB items because the OC final *-t is a nominalizing suffix for natural objects (§6.2.1), and OC *m- for foreign b- has parallels (§5.12.2).  ||  Alternatively, Baxter / Sagart (1998: 52) relate this word to → zhì18 質 ‘essential’ and note a possible relationship with PTai *mlet or *mret ‘grain, seed’ [Li F. 1977: 93]; the Tai word could, however, also be connected with → mǐ1 米 ‘rice’.

3554-Coldwind,Cold wind,,,3554-Coldwind,"  ‘Cold wind’ [SW, Chuci], ‘wind’ [Guǎngyǎ].  ||  [E] Etymology not clear. WT rdzi ‘wind’ which sī resembles (Unger Hao-ku 30, 1984: 294) belongs to PTB *g-li(y) ‘wind’ (STC no. 454): WB le ‘air, wind’, Tani rji ‘wind’. WT prob. derives from earlier *ryi. More promising may be a link with PWMiao *tc-ᶜ (tcuaᶜ¹ etc.) ‘wind’, especially since the CH word’s first textual occurrence is in Chǔcí. "
3556-Todie,To die,,,3556-Todie,"  ‘To die’ [OB, BI, Shi]. Tone B is prob. the result of re-interpretation as an endoactive word (§4.5).   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR sɿ (上); MGZY shi (上) [sɿ]; ONW si  ||  [E] ST: PTB *siy ‘to die’ (STC no. 232) > WT ’čʰi-ba < ɴsi, ši  ᛝ gšin-po ‘dead man’ ᛝ gšid ‘funeral’; Kanauri śi, Chepang si-sa, Garo si, PL *ʃe²; WB se ‘die, be extinguished’; JP si³³ ‘to die’ (HST: 62); Lushai tʰiᴴ / tʰiɁᴸ < tʰii / tʰiɁ ‘to die’. Unrelated to shī 尸 ‘corpse’ (under → yí5 夷侇). "

An OC *l in the initial is suggested by the variant graph; the initial *s- may be due to interference from sān 三 ‘three’ (Coblin 1986: 83).  ||  ST: In spite of phonological difficulties, sì is prob. a ST word because of the suspec- ted earlier *l in the CH initial: PTB *b-ləy ‘four’ [Matisoff 1995a: 52; STC: 94] > WT bži < *bli, Magari buli, PL *b-le², WB leᴮ, Lushai paᴸ-liᴴ < pa-lii; PKaren *lis (Benedict LTBA 5.1, 1979: 13). <> Tai: S. siiᴮ¹ is obviously a CH loan (no *l in the initial). "
3558-Snivel,Snivel,,,3558-Snivel,"  ‘Snivel’ [Shi]. The etymology is uncertain; Wáng Lì (1982: 418) relates sì to → tì1 涕 ‘tears, mucus from nose’, but see there.  "
3559-Toimitateresemble,"To imitate, resemble",,,3559-Toimitateresemble,"  ‘To imitate, resemble’ [Shi].  ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR zɿ (上); MGZY zhi (上) [zɿ]  ||  [E] This is reminiscent of TB-Lushai zirᴴ < jir ‘to learn, copy, imitate’, but the cognation requires the assumption of a ST root *ji(r). The TB items under → xiàng7 像象 could perh. belong to this etymon instead. "
3560-Wildwaterbuffalo,Wild water buffalo,,,3560-Wildwaterbuffalo,"  ‘Wild water buffalo’ [OB, Shi, EY] (Lefeuvre MS 39, 1990-91: 131-157). This word was sometimes mistakenly thought to be a variant of → xī11 犀 ‘rhinoceros’.  ||  [E] Area word: NTai *ǰiəᴬ/ᶜ (Li 1977) or *ǰiaᴬ (Gedney ICSTLL 1981) ‘ox, cow’, the OC and PTai initials are the same as in → xiàng5 象 ‘elephant’. <> TB-Lushai sialᴴ < sial ‘domestic buffalo’ seᴴ-leᴴ ‘wild gayal (buffalo)’ (se- is the contracted form of sialᴴ). The ultimate source of this word may be AA; note Munda sahil, saili ‘wild buffalo’, Gutob (Munda) saail ‘wild buffalo, deer’ [Pinnow 1959: 423]. However, the contact with OC would be so remote that a regular phonological history is elusive. "
3561-ploughsharetoplough,"ploughshare, to plough",,,3561-ploughsharetoplough,"  The usual gloss is ‘ploughshare, to plough’ [Shi]; however this implement consisted of a blade-like spade which was attached to a → lěi1 耒 digging stick which thus became its handle (Bodde 1975: 233ff), hence ‘spade, to cultivate with a spade’. It originated perh. in the Yao culture (W. Eberhard Lokalkulturen II: 224). Syn. → lí6 犁. "
3567-Pine,Pine,,,3567-Pine,"  ‘Pine’ (the tree) [Shi].   ||  [D] M-Xiàmén lit. sioŋᴬ², col. tsiŋᴬ²  ||  [E] This word has been associated with Old Japanese sugi² 杉 ‘cryptomeria’ (Miyake 1997: 197). See comment under → méi4 梅. It also has superficial similarity with Tai: S. son² ‘a pine’. "

Sōng is the name of several mountains in Henan, Shandong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, including the name of the sacred mountain, the axis mundi (D. Pankenier EC 20, 1995: 139), in Henan near Luòyáng which was already venerated during the Xia dynasty.  ||  [E] MK *sluŋ, *sluuŋ ‘high’ (Shorto 2006 #763): PMonic *slooŋ ‘be high up, high, tall’ (person, mountain), OMon s-lūŋ ‘be high’ ᛝ *s-m-loŋ ‘top’ (of something) ᛝ /clɔŋ/ ‘highest point, apex, spire’ ᛝ PMK *s-r-luuŋ (Shorto) > OMon sirluŋ ‘height’; Khmer /-lóoŋ/ ‘high, lofty’; Palaung hløøŋ ‘long’, PWa *hloŋ ‘high’ ᛝ *Ɂṃ-loŋ ‘hill’; Kharia ǰhalɔŋ ‘high’ ᛝ sɛløŋ ‘deep’.  ||  AA -> TB-SChin Daai msuuŋ ‘mountain’ [Hartmann ICSTLL 1999: 2].

Tai: S. suuŋᴬ¹ < *s- ‘high’ (Li F. 1976: 42) looks like a Chinese loan. A syn. or parallel stem with initial *r- is → lóng1 隆. "

"
3574-Quickly,Quickly,,,3574-Quickly,  ‘Quickly’ [Li]. 
3575-Beborndeaf,Be born deaf,,,3575-Beborndeaf,"  ‘Be born deaf’ [SW], a Han period dialect word from the eastern Huái-Yangtze region, in Chǔ and Chén [FY 6,2]. This word has the same meaning and OC rime as → lóng6 聾 *rôŋ ‘deaf’. The JY gives a variant reading shuǎng (ṣåŋᴮ) < *sroŋɁ which makes this word look like a s-prefix allofam of lóng, but this reading is late and might have been prompted by a gloss ‘deaf on “both” shuāng 雙 (ṣåŋ) ears’ [FY 6] (yet 雙 and 聳 have different tones). "
3577-Toescortfollowaftergoalong,"To escort, follow after, go along",,,3577-Toescortfollowaftergoalong,"  ‘To escort, follow after, go along’ [Shi], ‘to send’ [Zuo], ‘to present’ [Li].  ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR suŋ (去); MGZY sung (去) [suŋ]; ONW soŋ  ||  [D] M-Xiàmén lit. soŋᶜ¹, col. sɑŋᶜ¹  ||  [E] Etymology not certain. Note AA-PSBahn. *sɔːŋ ‘hand over’, and / or OKhmer jon /ɉoon/ ‘to urge, persuade, invite, ... drive, ... accompany, escort, ... bring to, offer, present’ (-> Thai chuən ‘to urge, persuade... ask, invite...’). Association with WT stoŋs-pa, bstaŋs ‘to accompany’ (Bodman 1980: 44), or with WT rdzoŋ-ba, (b)rdzaŋ(s) ‘to send, expedite, dismiss’ are problematic because the WT vowel a does not agree with OC *o.    ||  [C] It is not clear if there is an etymological connection with → cóng1 從 ‘follow’."

Alternatively, it may be connected with WT gsuŋs (pf. of gsuŋ) ‘to speak’ (resp.) (Unger Hao-ku), but the initials do not agree.    ||  [C] → xiōng5 神  is probably unrelated. "

3583-Tomove,To move,,,3583-Tomove,"  ‘To move’ [JY], Zhèng Xuán ‘vigorous and rapid’ (Karlgren Gl. 1154).  ||  [E] ST: PTB *m-sow ‘awake’ > Dimasa masau, Lushai tʰoR / tʰɔɁᴸ < soɁ / sɔs, Lai su ‘be awake’ ᛝ džə-su ‘awaken’ [VanBik LTBA 25.2, 2002: 106], Lakher pətʰeu, Khami əntʰau, Ao Naga meso ‘arise, awake’ (STC: 65 no. 295; p. 118); Tamang ²so ‘live’; WT gson-pa ‘be alive, to wake, rouse, urge on’; WB (ə-)cʰoᴮ ‘be quick’ ᛝ cʰo ‘to rouse, urge on’, soᶜ ‘quick, rapid’.  ||  This root ‘to rouse, move, make move, quicken, quick’ has spawned a prolific wf; as on other occasions, CH etymological connections become clear by way of the larger ST picture.

3584-Dog,Dog,,,3584-Dog,"  ‘Dog’; acc. to SW náo-sōu 獿獀 [nɑu-ṣu] is a Southern Yuè word (Mei / Norman 1976: 279). The role of the presyllable náo ‘monkey’ is not clear.  ||  [E] MK *cɔʔ ‘dog’ (Shorto 2006 #41): KhmuɁ, Palaung-Wa *sɔɁ; PSBahn. *sɔː, but PNBahn. chó, PVM *Ɂa-cɔːɁ > Viet. chó, Khmer ckae, PEKatuic *Ɂaco. If available MK forms are any guide, the underlying word with its fricative /s/ (not affricate /c/) does, contrary to SW, not seem to belong to the Yuè (Viet) branch of MK. For the initials, see §5.10.2. This word also appears in TB languages: Limbu kotco ‘dog’. "
3585-Threeyearoldbovine,Three-year-old bovine,,,3585-Threeyearoldbovine,"  ‘Three-year-old bovine’ [SW] (Baxter 1977: 287). The additional reading MC sâm is obviously that of the phonetic.  ||  [E] KD: PHlai *sr-: Baoding fu³, Zhong-shan tshu³ ‘three’ [Matisoff 1988c: 297], note also AN: PEastern Formosan *teluH ‘three’ [Li Jen-kuei LL 5.2, 2004: 370].  "
3586-Oldman,Old man,,,3586-Oldman,"  ‘Old man’ 叟 [Meng, Zuo], ‘blind’ 瞍 [Shi]. Wáng Lì (1982: 241) believes that sǎo 嫂 (sâuᴮ) ‘elder brother’s wife’ [Li] was originally the same etymon. However, old age and blindness are not necessarily defining features of an elder brother’s wife. "
3587-Grassymarshland,Grassy marshland,,,3587-Grassymarshland,"  ‘Grassy marshland’ 藪 [Shi], 挂 [Li] is perh. related to OTib. sog ‘grassland’ (Zhol inscr.) (HST: 88).  ||  [E] ? AA: PSBahn. suːh ‘wet, humid’. Alternatively, the word may be connected with sǒu 溲 (ṣjəuᴮ) [ṣuɁ] ‘soak’ [Shi]."

3590-Grassplant,"Grass, plant",,,3590-Grassplant,"  ‘Grass, plant’, a Han period Chǔ, Huái, Jiāng dialect word [FY 3,8].  ||  [E] This may be the same etymon as sù 蘇 ‘revive’ and belong to the wf → wù6 悟寤. The concepts ‘live’ ~ ‘fresh, green’ ~ ‘plant’ are often connected. Although the OC graph needs to be set up with an *sŋ-cluster, an alternative association with WT rtswa (prob. orthographic for *r-tsa < *r-sa) ‘grass, plants’ is also possible. By mid to late Han when this word appeared first in writing, an OC *sŋ- had simplified to *s- which made the graph then suitable for writing a word *sa. The item is not related to WT sŋo-ba ‘be green’ ᛝ sŋo ‘plant, vegetable, greens’; see → yuè1 月. "
3593-Rusticvulgarcustompopularusage,"Rustic, vulgar, custom, popular usage",,,3593-Rusticvulgarcustompopularusage,"  ‘Rustic, vulgar, custom, popular usage’ [Meng, Li].   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR zy (入); MGZY zÿu (入) [zy]; ONW zuok  ||  [D] M-Xiàmén lit. siokᴰ², col. sioɁᴰ²  ||  [E] Etymology not clear; either ST: WT lugs ‘custom, way, manner’ (HST: 60); or MK: Khmer jw /cúuə/ ‘be low, base, mean, common, vulgar’ (with additon of the CH -k, see §6.1). "
3595-Bewhitecolourlessplain,"Be white, colourless, plain",,,3595-Bewhitecolourlessplain,"  ‘Be white, colourless, plain’ (also figuratively) [BI, Shi].  ||  [E] AA: Khmer /sɑɑ/ ‘be white, colourless’ > ‘pure’ > ‘purify, clarify’ > ‘inquire onto, probe, examine’ ᛝ /sɑmnɑɑ/ ‘the white metals’ (this form suggests that a nasal might in fact have been present in OC, note OCB).  "
3596-Tosearchinquireintodemand,"To search, inquire into, demand",,,3596-Tosearchinquireintodemand,"  ‘To search, inquire into, demand’ [Zuo]. The Khmer forms below show the semantic connection between ‘white’ and ‘search’. "
3597-Earlymorningearlysoon,"Early morning, early, soon",,,3597-Earlymorningearlysoon,"  ‘Early morning, early, soon’ [Shi].   ||  [E] ST: PLB *C-sok ~ *V-sok ‘morning, morrow’ [Matisoff TSR no. 125], Lushai tuukF   ||  ‘early morning’ (< suuk?). WB sok-kra ‘Venus’ is a loan from Mon /sɯk/ and ultimately from Skt śukrá ‘bright, Venus’ (Shorto 1971: 379).  ||  [WFE] ST *so(w) ‘move’ (under → sōu3, sǒu 搜), PTB *m-sow ‘to stir, waken, move’; sù is ‘the time when one wakes up and gets moving’. The OC final *-k in this word has been inherited from ST: *so + ST *-k of uncertain function (§6.1). "
3598-Toquicken,To quicken,,,3598-Toquicken,"  ‘To quicken’ > ‘become pregnant’ [Shi] (Shaughnessy 1991: 103f) is prob. the same word as ‘early morning’ which is semantically derived from the notion ‘rouse, quicken’. Shaughnessy has concluded that in OB and a BI (early Zhou, Wǔ wáng) sù occasionally means ‘to rout’ (an enemy). This is supported by the semantic range of this wf, but it is not certain if sù was the actual word intended by the graph, rather than a semantically closer cognate under → sù6 速. "

We should expect a retroflex initial in MC, yet retroflection is occasionally lost, see for ex. → sù8 肅蒋. STC (155 n. 419; p. 171 n. 457) relates this word to the TB items noted under → yè1 夜, but the OC vowel *u as well as the initial are difficult to reconcile with TB. "

Shānhǎijīng implies that ‘Jupiter’ was already named suì at the beginning of the Zhou dynasty.   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR suj (去); MGZY sue (去) [suɛ]; ONW  suei  ||  [D] PMin *hueᶜ ‘year’ (of age) does not agree with the rest of Chinese dialects; perh. there is a Tai connection.   ||  [<] Prob. derived from → yuè4 越 ‘pass over’ (Mei Tsu-Lin Tsing Hua Journal of Chinese Studies 12.1, 1979: 117-32) with the iterative s-prefix  (§5.2.3); the original sense was either ‘travelling = passing planet’ = ‘Jupiter’ > ‘Jovian cycle’ > ‘year’ (Takashima 1996 II: 131), or ‘passing time period’ = ‘year’ > ‘year star, Jupiter’ (Mei). Alternatively, suì may be derived from a word like → yuán5 員圓圜 *wan < ST *val ‘circle’, then lit. ‘start the circle again’. In CH and many TB languages temporal units are seen as recurrent cycles; note zhōu 周 ‘circle’ > ‘week’.  ||  [E] Mei Tsu-Lin relates suì further to WT skyod ‘to go, walk; go down, set’, but see → yuè4 越. The connection with PTai *xuap > S. kʰuapᴰ¹ᴸ ‘year’ (of age of children) is not clear. Acc. to Bodman (1980: 66) Tai could be a loan from Chinese (OC *-ts from *-ts or *-ps). Note the Mǐn form which seems closer to Tai. Or, contrary to the preceding paragraph, the CH word might have originated in Kam-Tai, but an internal CH etymology is preferable."

There is no MC syllable like siwen in div. 4, therefore a front vowel i might have been lost early in OC *sûnɁ (from *suinɁ ?).  ||  [WFE] ST: TB cognates are perh. WT sun-pa ‘be tired of, weary, renounce, resign’, WB sun ‘fail, fall behind, turn away’ ᛝ sunᴮ ‘spent, expended’.   ||  [C] Sagart (1999: 82) suggests that this word family may be related to xún 循馴 (under → shùn1 順).

3631-Placepositionsituation,"Place, position, situation",,,3631-Placepositionsituation,"  ‘Place, position, situation’ [BI, Shi]. The function as an indefinite substitute for the post-verbal element (Dobson, LAC: 157), as in yǒu suǒ guī 有所歸 ‘have a place to return to’, or suǒ qù 所去 ‘what [the subject] rejects’, is derived from the noun ‘place’ (Pulleyblank 1995: 68). → yōu1 攸 provides an exact semantic parallel.   ||  [T] Sin Sukchu SR ʂu (上), LR ʂwɔ; MGZY (zhu >) shu (上) [ʂu]; ONW ṣø < ṣo  ||  [E] ST *sra > PTB *sra (HPTB: 78): JP ʃə³¹-ra³¹ ‘place’ (< *s-ra; Matisoff in STC: 171 n. 457), WB ra ‘place, situation, thing, subject’, Mru ra ‘place’ [Löffler 1966: 146], Dulong sə̂®`ɑ ‘thing’ [LaPolla LTBA 24.2, 2001: 2]. TB cognates to this word and to shì 事 ‘affair, thing’ (→ shì2 士仕) are difficult to distinguish. It is not clear if and how WT sa ‘place, earth’ and / or Zhangzhung slas ‘earth’ are related; WT sa is also often associated with → shā1 沙 *srai ‘sand’ – not likely. "

AA -> Tai: S. čʰ¨ıakᴰ²ᴸ < PTai * ǰ- ‘rope’, Saek saakᴰ² < z- ‘vines, rope’. In Mǐn and other southern dialects, this is the common word for ‘rope’ (as opposed to → shéng 繩 in the north). OC must have borrowed this word because foreign / ST *z- > OC s-, whereas OC *s- is not expected to become a voiced initial elsewhere. For a possible parallel development, see → xiāo2 消銷. Also the narrowed CH meaning ‘rope’ speaks in favor of a foreign origin. "

Baxter (1992; also CVST  3:18) relates tà to TB-WT sleb-pa, (b)slebs ‘to arrive, reach, extend’ and sets up an OC initial *l-; he also relates tà to → dài8 逮.  ||  An OC T-like initial would connect the word with MK *bɗap, *bɗaap ‘to touch, adjoin’  ‌(Shorto ɐ1264) with which tà agrees closely in meaning.  The OC and MK vowels are different, but uncertainty of vowels is often encountered in MK (peruse Shorto 2006) and OC. TB items under dié6  輒 partially overlap with tà. "

3652-Tokill,To kill,,,3652-Tokill,"  ‘To kill’ is a Han-period Chǔ dialect word [FY 1,16], cognate to lán 惏(lậm) which was a Chén-Chǔ dialect word for ‘kill’ [FY 2, 19]. It is doubtful that this root is connected with → kān4 戡 ‘kill’ (a southern Chǔ-Xiāng dialect word), or with cǎn 慘 (tsʰậmᴮ) ‘to kill’ [FY 1,5], though all these forms could theoretically derive from the same root (so Sagart 1999: 151).

The initial of the phonet. series is not certain; the word may be related to → shēn3 深 ‘deep’ (provided the initial was OCM *nh-; so Unger Hao-ku 47, 1995).

Alternatively, wáng may possibly be connected with an AA homophone: OKhmer vaṅ ~ vāṅ(ṅ) ‘royal palace ...’ (-> Tai: S. waŋ ‘palace’), cognate to luəŋ ‘king’ (-> Tai luaŋ ‘royal’); the identification of ‘king’ with his palace is perh. supported by a BI where wáng refers not to the Zhou king but to a place (Shaughnessy 1991: 197).

The Han period (FY) association with the language of Wú and Yuè (Viet) seems to strengthens the possibility that this is originally a MK etymon: Pearic saː ‘each other’.

4238-School,School,,,4238-School,"  ‘School’ [Meng] has two possible etymologies: (1) it is the same word as ‘north-south (east-west) running walls at sides of a hall, space or galleries close to such walls’ [Shi] (under → xù2 序敘緒) (Wáng Lì 1982: 170). (2) It is an allofam of → xiáng2 庠 ‘school’ (Pulleyblank 1962: 233) which is perh. derived from → yáng7 揚 ‘rise, raise’. In fact, xù may be parallel to xiáng in being derived from → yú11 舁譽 ‘to lift’. It must be pure coincidence that Modern Khmer ‘school’ səlaa is nearly identical to OC. "

4240-Torubbrush,"To rub, brush",,,4240-Torubbrush,"  ‘To rub, brush’ [Li]. The phonetic → xuè1 血 implies an OC *swit, but the likely cognate → sāo1 搔 *su ‘to scratch’ as well as the TB cognate require an OC *sut. Since Lǐjì is a relatively late text, OC *swit and *sut may already have merged into *suit and have made the phonetic suitable for this word.  ||  [E] ST: PLB *sut ‘wipe, sweep’ [Matisoff, Variational Semantics] > WB sut ‘wipe’, Lahu šìɁ < *sit."

4256-Slackindulgent,"Slack, indulgent",,,4256-Slackindulgent,"  ‘Slack, indulgent’ [Zuo], ‘soft’ [Lü] is perh. related (HST: 136); but this word could instead belong to → yuán8 爰 ‘slow’. Syn. → róu1 柔 "
4258-Blackdark,"Black, dark",,,4258-Blackdark,"  ‘Black, dark’ [BI, Shi] is the oldest basic colour term for ‘black’ which is later replaced by → hēi 黑 (Baxter 1983). "

4263-Toflow,To flow,,,4263-Toflow,  ‘To flow’ [Lun] may derive from the same ST root *lwi ‘to flow’ as → shuǐ 水  ‘water’; earlier *r- and *l- often leave no trace in MC before initial *j- and *w-.

The similarity with MK-Mon ra is interesting: ra “especially at closing sentence, marking unqualified character of assertion,” perh. originally the weak form of das ‘to be’ (Shorto 1971). Alternatively, yě may be of ST origin, being connected with the WT suffix -la which usually marks the dative case, but is also used as a topicalizer like ni ‘as for....’ (Beyer 1992: 278). "

In later parts it rimes with words in *-akh (OCB *-aks) (Shi 17.1; 100.3); in one older ode (Xiǎoyǎ 194.2) yè rimes with words in *-ak. This distribution suggests that in early Zhou times one strain of OC was lacking the *-k. In any case, OC often adds a final *-k to words which in TB have open vowels (§6.1), therefore this is the ST etymon for ‘night’.  ||  [E] ST: PTB *ya ‘night’ (STC no. 417) > Chepang yaɁ-diŋ ‘night’, yoh ‘yesterday’, yoh-dyah-may ‘last night’; WB ´ñaᶜ ‘evening’ < ne-ja ‘sun-night’, JP naɁ⁵⁵ < nak⁵⁵ ‘evening’; Dulong ɉɑɁ ‘night’, Karen hja (STC p. 188).

4803-Music,Music,,,4803-Music,"  ‘Music’ [Shi].  ||  [E] The etymological relationship with → lè3 樂 ‘joy’ has been much debated, extensively by K. Wulff (Det Kgl.

For the semantics Unger draws attention to WT rol-ba ‘to enjoy’ vs. rol-mo ‘music’. On the other hand, there is no other example of QY initial ŋ- ~ l- in a wf. In the popular mind, the concept ‘music’ can easily be connected with ‘joy’, hence perh. the same graph for these near homophones. The graph 樂 originally wrote ‘oak’ lì 櫟 (liek), OCM *riâuk which is therefore the actual phonetic. "

Therefore one or other of the numerous synonymous and similar-looking roots in the area (see under → huí 回) is probably represented here. Closest is perh. AA-Khmer /wul/ ‘to turn (around), revolve, rotate, spin, whirl, eddy, swirl’. From *wul to *wun is only one phonological step; an equally appropriate root PTB *wir would instead require two steps, in addition to -r > -n also the change u > i (§11.5.1): TB-Lushai virR < virɁ ‘rotate, revolve, spin’ ᛝ virᴸ < virh (< -s) ‘a whorl’, Mru wir ‘rotate, spin’, WT ’kʰyir-ba ‘to turn round in a circular course’, JP-Hkauri kə-wīn ‘rotate’ [Matisoff 1974: 166]; WB ə-kʰyin ‘a time period, season’ (for semantics, note xún 旬 under → jūn2 鈞).

Curiously, in a passage in Zuǒzhuàn (Xuan 17) 豸 is supposedly a graphic loan for 解 which raises the suspicion that the latter ended up as a pre-syllable in the animal name due to a misunderstood gloss.
